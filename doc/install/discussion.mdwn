No matter what I do, ikiwiki gives me a `Can't locate loadable object for module Locale::gettext in @INC` although I've installed (and reinstalled) the Locale module, and no luck. If I look at the directories in the INC path, I can see the file. The wiki won't compile in spite of this, and I've tried everything I can think of.. -- [[tychoish]]

I am trying to install Ikiwiki version 2.1 from the source tarball.

It has all gone fairly smoothly until I try and run 'make'.

I.e. I have downloaded and unpacked ikiwiki_2.1.tar.gz and have run

    perl Makefile.PL

... which has run OK.


However when I then run 'make' I get:-

    LANG=C perl -I.  -T ikiwiki.out doc html --templatedir=templates \
                    --underlaydir=basewiki --nousedirs\
                    --wikiname="ikiwiki" --verbose \
                    --exclude=/discussion --no-discussion --userdir=users \
                    --plugin=goodstuff \
                    --plugin=haiku --plugin=polygen --plugin=fortune
    Failed to load plugin IkiWiki::Plugin::mdwn: IkiWiki version 2 required--this is only version 1.01 at IkiWiki/Plugin/mdwn.pm line 7.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at IkiWiki/Plugin/mdwn.pm line 7.
    Compilation failed in require at (eval 4) line 2.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 4) line 2.

    make: *** [extra_build] Error 1
 
How do I fix this?  There may be a bit of old ikiwiki left behind because
I did once have an older version installed but I thought I had removed all
traces of it.

Well I have searched around and there really is nothing left that I can see.

I have removed *everything* found by 'find' and 'locate' that contains 'ikiwiki' except the tar file
and started from the beginning again and I see exactly the same error.

Is it that I maybe have a too old version of some of the Perl dependencies?  The only mdwn.pm files
that I have are the two I have just extracted from the new tar file.  There is *no* ./IkiWiki.pm file

> It's interesting that you say you have no ./IkiWiki.pm file, since one is

so what/where is it loading to satisfy the ....... aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

I wasn't noticing the case of the filename, I'd missed the upper case W and guess what 'find' shows me:-

    /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/IkiWiki.pm

Removing the above file has fixed my basic problem, now I'm getting lots of (non-fatal) errors
about "Can't locate Locale/gettext.pm", presumably that's a missing Perl module, I can probably
sort that out.


## Errors when running 'make test'

OK, I've now got it to compile and install and presumably it's basically working.  However there
are a few errors when I run 'make test'.  Several errors have disappeared by installing more Perl
stuff (specifically XML::SAX) 

> XML::SAX is a requirement of XML::Simple, which is a documented build
> requirement. (Only really needed if you'll be using subversion actually).

and one error disappeared when I did a 'make install', i.e. the 'make
test' has a test which requires IkiWiki to be installed first.

> Yes, that bug is already fixed in subversion for the next release
> --[[Joey]]

However I'm still getting the following error in 'make test':-

	t/pagename.................ok

home$ perl -v

This is perl, v5.8.8 built for i486-linux

## Installation in a non-root enviroment
I had a pretty hellacious time installing Ikiwiki (largely due to problems
in Perl) and documented them in [[tips/Dreamhost]].  I'd like to get feedback on the doc and also know if I should file a few bugs to make the installation process a little friendlier to non-root folks.  Thanks for the great app!


## Typing error?

[..] Mail::Sendmail, TimeDate, RPC::XML, [..]: should be DateTime? --[[vibrog]]

> No, TimeDate and DateTime are two different CPAN modules. Ikiwiki uses
> TimeDate. --[[Joey]]

ah, i still don't fully get it, though (the following is slightly shortened):

    $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
    cpan> install DateTime
    DateTime is up to date.
    cpan> install TimeDate
    Warning: Cannot install TimeDate, don't know what it is.
    Try the command
        i /TimeDate/
    to find objects with matching identifiers.

I'm trying to build IkiWiki on a fresh OpenSuse 10.3 box. I start out with

    $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Text::Markdown URI HTML::Parser HTML::Template HTML::Scrubber'
    $ git clone git://git.ikiwiki.info/ ikiwiki && cd ikiwiki
    $ perl Makefile.PL && make

Are there other prerequisites?
I also installed all optional Perl modules, except TimeDate.

> TimeDate is also, confusingly, known as Date::Parse. Perhaps CPAN would
> do better with that name. --[[Joey]]

good. Date::Parse was already installed. --[[vibrog]]

`make` exits with `make: *** [extra_build] Aborted`, `make test` complains `cannot stat 'ikiwiki.man'` --[[vibrog]]

I've tried a couple of times and my cpan has never recognised Bundle::IkiWiki. Is that section of the page still accurate? -- [[users/Jon]]

> Are you running perl with the environemnt settings specified on the page?
> Can you show how it fails to find the bundle? --[[Joey]]

>> I was not. Next time I build I will have to try that (I'll need to tweak it as I already override PERL5LIB; also I need to specify http proxies). Thanks for your help! -- [[users/Jon]]

##Further problems with Bundle::IkiWiki
I'm also having trouble with finding Bundle::IkiWiki.  I've tried it with the environment settings and without them, and also using the interactive 
form of the cpan command.  I've also gone to cpan.org and searched -- eg

    http://search.cpan.org/search?query=ikiwiki&mode=all

and no Bundle for IkiWiki comes up at all.

The error I get from the various cpan attempts is basically always the same:

    Warning: Cannot install Bundle::IkiWiki, don't know what it is.
    Try the command

        i /Bundle::IkiWiki/

    to find objects with matching identifiers.

When I try that command, BTW, it basically seems to find the same stuff I get when searching on the cpan web site.

This happens both on Ubuntu 8.04 and CentOS 5.1

Any help would be greatly appreciated... --kent

Just today I noticed the "Bundle" subdirectory.  What a moron I am! :-)  Also, I misunderstood the PERL5LIB=`pwd` part -- 
I glibly thought it indicated the sink for the installation of the modules, rather than the source, and I was running 
the cpan command from another window in a different directory, and just spiraled down into error...

For ubuntu 8.04: 

    $ ikiwiki --version
    ikiwiki version 2.32.3ubuntu2.1
    $

I was just trying to get the latest version.

In any case, thanks for the help, and thanks for the superb software.  I really like it a lot.

## Prerequisite modules not found for non-root user
Hi, I'm a non-root user trying to use IkiWiki on an academic webserver with Perl 5.8.8 but several missing modules, so I grab them from CPAN (edited):

    cd ~; PERL5LIB=`pwd`/ikiwiki:`pwd`/ikiwiki/cpan:`pwd`/lib/perl5 PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("Bundle::IkiWiki")'

That puts a lot of files in ~/.cpan. Then when I go into the directory where I untarred IkiWiki and try to run the Perl makefile:

    cd ~/ikiwiki; perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/ikiwiki

I get warnings that all the modules needed were not found:

Warning: prerequisite CGI::FormBuilder  not found.
Warning: prerequisite CGI::Session 0 not found.
Warning: prerequisite Date::Parse 0 not found.
Warning: prerequisite HTML::Scrubber 0 not found.
Warning: prerequisite HTML::Template 0 not found.
Warning: prerequisite Mail::Sendmail 0 not found.
Warning: prerequisite Text::Markdown 0 not found.

CORRECTION 1: I played around with CPAN and got the installation to the point of succeeding with >99% of tests in "make test".

> What was the magic CPAN rune that worked for you? --[[Joey]] 

An attempt of "make install" failed while trying to put files in /etc/IkiWiki but per the output's instructions, I reran "make install" and that seemed to work, until this error, which doesn't seem to be satisfiable:

    Warning: You do not have permissions to install into /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i386-linux-thread-multi at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/ExtUtils/Install.pm line 114.

    mkdir /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/IkiWiki: Permission denied at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/ExtUtils/Install.pm line 176

Any suggestions? Whew!

03 September 2010, Report on successful manual install in Debian 5 (Lenny) AMD64:

note: Maybe much more easy using backports, but using this tools you get a plain user cpan  :)

This where my steps:

As root (#):

        aptitude install build-essential curl perl


As plain user ($), I use to install user perl modules using local::lib

        mkdir -p "$HOME/downloads"
        cd "$HOME/downloads/"
        wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GE/GETTY/local-lib-1.006007.tar.gz
        wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/i/ikiwiki/ikiwiki_3.20100831.tar.gz
        tar -zxf local-lib-1.006007.tar.gz 
        cd local-lib-1.006007/
        perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap=~/.perl5
        make test && make install
        echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/.perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib=$HOME/.perl5)' >>~/.bashrc
        . ~/.bashrc
        curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
        cpanm CGI::FormBuilder
        cpanm CGI::Session
        cpanm HTML::Parser
        cpanm HTML::Template
        cpanm HTML::Scrubber
        cpanm Text::Markdown
        cpanm URI
        cd ..
        tar -zxf ikiwiki_3.20100831.tar.gz
        cd ikiwiki/
        perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE= PREFIX=/home/$USER/.perl5
        make test    # All tests successful.
        make install INSTALL_BASE=/home/$USER/.perl5
        . ~/.bashrc

Using cpan or cpanm with local::lib, you can install any other dependency, as plain user (in your home). XS modules may need -dev packages.

After all, here it's:

        ikiwiki -version
        ikiwiki version 3.20100831

It seems like this installation looses the /etc files (we're as plain user), but this can be used as a workaround:

        ikiwiki -setup ~/downloads/ikiwiki/auto.setup

I've not investigated more the /etc files ussage, but does not seems like a good idea to be as plain user...

        /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist does not exist
        ** Failed to add you to the system wikilist file.
        ** (Probably ikiwiki-update-wikilist is not SUID root.)
        ** Your wiki will not be automatically updated when ikiwiki is upgraded.

Portability fixes encountered while maintaining the pkgsrc package:

* In `IkiWiki::Setup::Standard::gendump()`, generate a shebang
  matching the current `perl`.
* In `Makefile.PL`, provide overridable defaults for `SYSCONFDIR`
  and `MANDIR`.
* In `Makefile.PL`, use `perl` to bump `ikiwiki.spec` instead of
  `sed -i`.
* In `Makefile.PL`, specify more portable options to `cp`.

I've attempted to mergeably patch these in my git, commit
5c177c96ac98b24aaa0613ca241fb113f1b32c55.
