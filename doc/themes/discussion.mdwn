I would like to contribute a theme I created and posted on github:

[[https://github.com/AntPortal/ikiwiked]]

For an example of the theme in action, see: [[https://antportal.com/wiki/]]

What is the process for merging a theme in Ikiwiki? It seems to me the
[[Bootstrap theme|http://www2.tblein.eu/posts/How_to_have_a_nice_design_for_ikiwiki/]]
could improve the options a lot... See the [[theme market]] for the
links to the actual theme. -- [[anarcat]]
