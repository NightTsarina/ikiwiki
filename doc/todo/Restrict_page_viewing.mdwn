I'd like to have some pages of my wiki to be only viewable by some users.

I could use htaccess for that, but it would force the users to have 
2 authentication mecanisms, so I'd prefer to use openID for that too.

* I'm thinking of adding a "show" parameter to the cgi script, thanks 
  to a plugin similar to goto.
* When called, it would check the credential using the session stuff 
  (that I don't understand yet). 
* If not enough, it would serve a 403 error of course.
* If enough, it would read the file locally on the server side and 
  return this as a content.

Then, I'd have to generate the private page the regular way with ikiwiki,
and prevent apache from serving them with an appropriate and 
much more maintainable htaccess file.
