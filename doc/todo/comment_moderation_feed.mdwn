There should be a way to generate a feed that is updated whenever a new
comment needs moderation. Otherwise, it can be hard to remember to check
sites, which may rarely get comments.

The feed should not include the comment subject or body, but could mention
the author. It would be especially handy if it was generated statically.
One way would be to generate internal pages corresponding to each comment
that needs moderation; then the feed could be constructed via a usual
inline.
