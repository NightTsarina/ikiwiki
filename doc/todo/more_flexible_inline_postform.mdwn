Using the [[plugins/inline]] plugin, you can get an inline-postform for
creating new pages.

It would be quite nice to have the flexibility to do this outside of the
inline directive.

I've got a proof-of-concept hacked inline comment submission example at
<http://dev.jmtd.net/comments/> for example. I've just copied the HTML from
the post form and stuck it inside a [[plugins/toggle]].

(Before Simon completed the comments plugin, I thought this would the a
logical first step towards doing comment-like things with inlined pages).
