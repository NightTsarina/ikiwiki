[[!tag plugins/meta patch]]
[[!template id=gitbranch branch=jon/defaultmeta author="[[Jon]]"]]

I'd like to define [[plugins/meta]] values to apply across all pages
site-wide unless the pages define their own: default values for meta
definitions essentially.

    <snip old patch, see below for latest>

> This doesn't support multiple-argument meta directives like
> `link=x rel=y`, or meta directives with special side-effects like
> `updated`.
>
> The first could be solved (if you care) by a syntax like this:

>     meta_defaults => [
>         { copyright => "© me" },
>         { link => "about:blank", rel => "silly", },
>     ]
>
> The second could perhaps be solved by invoking `meta::preprocess` from within
> `scan` (which might be a simplification anyway), although this is complicated
> by the fact that some (but not all!) meta headers are idempotent.
