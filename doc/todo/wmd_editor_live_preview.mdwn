Some time ago there was [[a question|http://ikiwiki.info/forum/wmd_editor_double_preview/]] in the forum about wmd editor and preview. However there were no answers:

I use the wmd editor in my ikiwiki. However live preview seems not to be a fully correct preview so nevertheless I have to hit the preview button to get a correct preview. However then I have two previews so that I have to scroll down to see the correct one.

Is it possible to disable the live preview or to replace the live preview with the correct one after pressing the preview button?
