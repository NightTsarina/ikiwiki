[[!tag patch patch]]

I was trying to get htmltidy to [play nicely with MathML][play].  Unfortunately, I couldn't construct a command line that I was happy with, but along the way I altered htmltidy to allow a configurable command line.  This seemed like a generally useful thing, so I've published my [patch][] as a Git branch.
