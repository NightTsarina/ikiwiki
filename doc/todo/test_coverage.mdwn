It would be nice for `make coverage` (or something) to produce a HTML
test-coverage report. I found this very useful for test-driven development of
[[plugins/contrib/trail]].

Limitations of the current branch, which uses [[!cpan Devel::Cover]]:

* Some tests use `./blib` and some use `.` so coverage gets split between
  the two copies of each module; not a problem for [[plugins/contrib/trail]]
  which only has one test.

* The [[plugins/git]] and [[plugins/mercurial]] plugins want to `chdir`,
  and so does [[!cpan Devel::Cover]], so they fight. For now, those tests
  are disabled under `make coverage`.
