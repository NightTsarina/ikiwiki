[[!tag patch]]
[[!template id=gitbranch branch=smcv/trail3 author="[[smcv]]"]]

My branch for [[plugins/contrib/trail]] also includes `path`
and `path_natural` sort orders, which sort the entire page name,
e.g. "a a/z ab ab/c b", much like [[ikiwiki/directive/map]].
I used `path` as the default order for the
[[plugins/contrib/ikiwiki/directive/trailitems]] directive,
since it seemed the most sensible.
([[plugins/contrib/ikiwiki/directive/trailinline]] uses
`age` as its default, to be consistent with `inline`.)

It's one commit (including a regression test) which can be
cherry-picked if you don't want the rest of `trail`.
