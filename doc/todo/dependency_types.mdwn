Ikiwiki currently only has one type of dependency between pages
(plus wikilinks special cased in on the side). This has resulted in various
problems, and it's seemed for a long time to me that ikiwiki needs to get
smarter about what types of dependencies are supported.

### unnecessary work

The current single dependency type causes the depending page to be rebuilt
whenever a matching dependency is added, removed, or *modified*. But a
great many things don't care about the modification case, and often cause
unnecessary page rebuilds:

* map only cares if the pages are added or removed. Content change does
  not matter (unless show=title is used).
* brokenlinks, orphans, pagecount, ditto (generally)
* inline in archive mode cares about page title, author changing, but
  not content. (Ditto for meta with show=title.)
* Causes extra work when solving the [[bugs/transitive_dependencies]]
  problem.

### proposal

I propose the following. --[[Joey]] 

* Add a second type of dependency, call it an "presence dependency".
* `add_depends` defaults to adding a regular ("full") dependency, as
  before. (So nothing breaks.)
* `add_depends($page, $spec, presence => 0)` adds an presence dependency.
* `refresh` only looks at added/removed pages when resolving presence
  dependencies.

This seems straightforwardly doable. I'd like [[Will]]'s feedback on it, if
possible. The type types of dependencies I am proposing are not identical
to the two types he talks about above, but I hope are close enough that
they can be used.

This doesn't deal with the stuff that only depend on the metadata of a
page, as collected in the scan pass, changing.  But it does leave a window
open for adding such a dependency type later.

----

I implemented the above in a branch.
[[!template id=gitbranch branch=origin/dependency-types author="[[joey]]"]]

Then I found some problems:

* Something simple like pagecount, that seems like it could use a
  presence dependency, can have a pagespec that uses metadata, like
  `author()` or `copyright()`.
* pagestats, orphans and brokenlinks cannot use presence dependencies
  because they need to update when links change.

Now I'm thinking about having a special dependency look at page
metadata, and fire if the metadata changes. And it seems links should
either be included in that, or there should be a way to make a dependency
that fires when a page's links change. (And what about backlinks?)

It's easy to see when a page's links change, since there is `%oldlinks`.
To see when metadata is changed is harder, since it's stored in the
pagestate by the meta plugin. Also, there are many different types of
metadata, that would need to be matched with the pagespecs somehow.

Quick alternative: Make add_depends look at the pagespec. Ie, if it
is a simple page name, or a glob, we know a presence dependency
can be valid. If's more complex, convert the dependency from
presence to full.

There is a lot to dislike about this method. Its parsing of the pagespec,
as currently implemented, does not let plugins add new types of pagespecs
that only care about presence. Its pagespec parsing is also subject to
false negatives (though these should be somewhat rare, and no false
positives). Still, it does work, and it makes things like simple maps and
pagecounts much more efficient.

----

#### Will's first pass feedback.

If the API is going to be updated, then it would be good to make it forward compatible.
I'd like for the API to be extendible to what is useful for complex pagespecs, even if we
that is a little redundant at the moment.

My attempt to play with this is in my git repo.  [[!template id=gitbranch branch=origin/depends-spec author="[[will]]"]]
That branch is a little out of date, but if you just look at the changes in IkiWiki.pm you'll see the concept I was looking at.
I added an "add_depends_spec()" function that adds a dependency on the pagespec passed to it.  If the set of matched pages
changes, then the dependent page is rebuilt.  At the moment the implementation uses the same hack used by map and inline -
just add all the pages that currently exist as traditional content dependencies.

Getting back to commenting on your proposal:

Just talking about the definition of a "presence dependency" for the moment, and ignoring implementation.  Is a
"presence dependency" supposed to cause an update when a page disappears?  I assume so.  Is a presence dependency
supposed to cause an update when a pages existence hasn't changed, but it no longer matches the pagespec.
(e.g. you use `created_before(test_page)` in a pagespec, and there was a page, `new_page`, that was created
after `test_page`.  `new_page` will not match the spec.  Now we'll delete and then re-create `test_page`.  Now
`new_page` will match the spec, and yet `new_page` itself hasn't changed.  Nor has its 'presence' - it was present
before and it is present now.  Should this cause a re-build of any page that has a 'presence' dependency on the spec?

I think that is another version of the problem you encountered with meta-data.

In the longer term I was thinking we'd have to introduce a concept of 'internal pagespec dependencies'.  Note that I'm
defining 'internal' pagespec dependencies differently to the pagespec dependencies I defined above.  Perhaps an example:
If you had a pagespec that was `created_before(test_page)`, then you could list all pages created before `test_page`
with a `map` directive.  The map directive would add a pagespec dependency on `created_before(test_page)`.
Internally, there would be a second page-spec parsing function that discovers which pages a given pagespec
depends on.  As well as the function `match_created_before()`, we'd have to add a new function `depend_created_before()`.
This new function would return a list of pages, which when any of them change, the output of `match_created_before()`
would change.  In this example, it would just return `test_page`.

These lists of dependent pages could just be concatenated for every `match_...()` function in a pagespec - you can ignore
the boolean formula aspects of the pagespec for this.  If a content dependency were added on these pages, then I think 
the correct rebuilds would occur.  

In all, this is a surprisingly difficult problem to solve perfectly.  Consider the following case:

PageA.mdwn:

> [ShavesSelf]

PageB.mdwn

> Doesn't shave self.

ShavedByBob.mdwn:

> [!include pages="!link(ShavesSelf)"]

Does ShavedByBob.mdwn include itself?

(Yeah - in IkiWiki currently links are included by include, but the idea holds.  I had a good example a while back, but I can't think of it right now.)

sigh.

### Link dependencies

* `add_depends($page, $spec, links => 1, presence => 1)`
  adds a links + presence dependency.
* `refresh` only rebuilds a page with a links dependency if
  pages matched by the pagespec gain or lose links. (What the link
  actually points to may change independent of this, due to changes
  elsewhere, without it firing.)
* So, brokenlinks can fire whenever any links in any of the
  pages it's tracking change, or when pages are added or
  removed.
* To determine if a pagespec is valid to be used with a links dependency,
  use the same set that are valid for presence dependencies. But also
  allow `backlinks()` to be used in it, since that matches pages
  that the page links to, which is just what link dependencies are
  triggered on.

### the removal problem

So far I have not addressed fixing the removal problem (which Will
discusses above).

Summary of problem: A has a dependency on a pagespec such as
"bugs/* and !link(done)". B currently matches. Then B is updated,
in a way that makes A's dependency not match it (ie, it links to done).
Now A is not updated, because ikiwiki does not realize that it
depended on B before.

This was worked around to fix [[bugs/inline_page_not_updated_on_removal]]
by inline and map adding explicit dependencies on each page that appears
on them. Then a change to B triggers the explicit dep. While this works,
it's 1) ugly 2) probably not implemented by all plugins that could
be affected by this problem (ie, linkmap) and 3) is most of the reason why
we grew the complication of `depends_simple`.

One way to fix this is to include with each dependency, a list of pages
that currently match it. If the list changes, the dependency is triggered.

Should be doable, but seems to involve a more work than
currently. Consider that a dependency on "bugs/*" currently
is triggered by just checking until *one* page is found to match it.
But to store the list, *every* page would have to be tried against it.
Unless the list can somehow be intelligently updated, looking at only the
changed pages.
