The [stay of execution](http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=commit;h=6660fd643bf3b65745d62b24cb16fef1b5205207) of Google's OpenID support, possibly until 2017,
_only_ applies to ikiwikis that had already been live and whose `openid_realm`s had been
seen by Google in at least one request by 19 May 2014, or whose admins had emailed Google to
request an extension by 15 June 2014 ... this according to Miguel Andres's answer on
[this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23773275/changed-domain-error-openid-auth-request-contains-an-unregistered-domain).

Google will not work as an OpenID provider for any ikiwiki set up since that time.

So, probably that Google option shouldn't be in the OpenID selector; maybe there
should be an option: default _off_, can be turned _on_ for an established ikiwiki
instance that is known to be grandfathered.
