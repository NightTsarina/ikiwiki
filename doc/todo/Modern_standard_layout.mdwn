I think it would be a good idea to think about the standard layout style of ikiwiki, the current layout used in a standard setup and on ikiwiki.info as well looks a bit old-fashioned to me. I guess that a nice modern layout would attract more new ikiwiki users and boost the ikwiki community... 

> FWIW, I agree.  The actiontabs [[theme|themes]] would be a better default, but something which showed what ikiwiki was capable of (or more precicely: that ikiwiki is as capable as other popular wiki softwares) would be better still. — [[Jon]]

----                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                       
Is it still Joey's opinion that ikiwiki.info should remain using the anti-theme?                                       
                                                                                                                       
I'd like to make one last, clear petition to move ikiwiki.info to using the actiontabs                                 
theme. Rationale below.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                       
I wanted to just ask one last time if that was still the case. I've been considering                                   
picking back up my ikiwiki hacking efforts,  as well as thinking about my personal use                                 
of ikiwiki, and I was privately pondering on the health of the project. IMHO, it's not                                 
great unfortunately, and we could use more contributors. I feel that the anti-theme on                                 
ikiwiki.info is putting off potential users and thus potential contributors. The                                       
actiontabs theme would be a better "advert" for ikiwiki: a better demonstration of what                                
you *could* do with it, and I think that's an important function of the site. I think                                  
people might come across ikiwiki.info whilst looking for basic information on the project                              
and be put off by the anti-theme.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                       
Honestly, I also find it hard to read information on the site due to the anti-theme (yes,                              
the default font face and size etc. are my own brower's preferences, but I sometimes use                               
browsers on other machines that I have not configured), including the wide (lack of)                                   
content margins, and prefer to interact with it (generally) using local clones.                                        
(I've just made *this* edit this way, but actually because the login process via email                                 
seems to be broken for edit/preview workflow. I might investigate/file about that later.)                              
                                                                                                                       
I wonder if someone feels the same, since you defaulted to actiontabs on branchable.
