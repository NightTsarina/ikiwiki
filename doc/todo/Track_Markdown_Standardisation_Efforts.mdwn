Just a quick note that some people are making noise about Markdown standardisation.  Specifically:

  * <http://markdown.github.com/>
  * <http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/the-future-of-markdown.html>
  * <http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/faq.html#what-are-some-big-questions-that-the-markdown-spec-does-not-answer>
  * <http://commonmark.org/>

It might be worth following...

> ikiwiki does not implement Markdown: we use a third-party library for that
> (there are several options, but the recommended one is currently
> [[!cpan Text::Markdown::Discount]]). We support whatever dialect
> of Markdown is implemented by the chosen Markdown implementation.
>
> As a result, nothing is likely to change in ikiwiki's interpretation of
> Markdown unless someone either changes the behaviour of Discount,
> or recommends a different (and hopefully better) third-party library.

> Presumably, Commonmark will become official in 2016, but you know what

> I guess the only thing that Ikiwiki would need to do would be to 
> somewhat support Commonmark. There's a Perl library that wraps the C
> library here: https://metacpan.org/release/CommonMark
>
> I guess we would need to test how it performs and compares with 
> Discount, but having it as a third party module is up for anyone's
> grab. It should be a fairly simple implementation after all...
