At the moment, IkiWiki allows you to set the template for individual pages using the [[plugins/pagetemplate]] directive/plugin, but not for whole sections of the wiki.

I've written a new plugin, sectiontemplate, available in the `page_tmpl` branch of my git repository that allows setting the template by pagespec in the config file.

>> I started with the pagetemplate plugin, which is why they're so similar.  I guess they could be combined.
>> I had a brief think about having the specs and templates defined in a directive rather than the config file, but it got tricky.
>> How do you know what needs to be rebuilt when?  There is probably a solution, maybe even an obvious one, but I thought that getting something done was more important than polishing it.
>> In the worst case, admins can always use the web interface to change the setup :).

>> I wanted this to put comments on my new blog, and was more interested in that goal than this subgoal.  I've moved most of my web pages to IkiWiki and there is only one small part that is the blog.
>> I wanted to use [[Disqus comments|tips/Adding_Disqus_to_your_wiki/]], but only on the blog pages.  (I'm using Disqus rather than IkiWiki comments because I don't want to have to deal with spam, security, etc.  I'll happily just let someone else host the comments.) -- [[Will]]

>>>> This is exactly what I was looking for and it took me a while to find it. I very much support the idea to provide this as a regular plugin, be it merged with pagetemplate or stand-alone. Thank you for your work and code! --BenTo

>>>> Any update on this. This could be very helpful as I plan to run a section of a wiki with a different language (and language settings like RTL-ed CSS). --Nezmer
