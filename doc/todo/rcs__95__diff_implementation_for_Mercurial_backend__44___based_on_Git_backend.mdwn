(**Note:** this patch is built on top of [[Attempt to extend Mercurial backend support]] and [[rcs__95__get__123__c__44__m__125__time_implementation_for_Mercurial_backend__44___based_on_Git_backend]]. The former is needed for the `safe_hg()` definition. The latter only shows up in the very last line matching of this patch.)

CC of `rcs_diff` implementation in `git.pm` with few changes. Mercurial provides the `hg diff -g` switch, which outputs the diff in Git-format, making the implementation easy. I think it's a good idea to base `mercurial.pm` as much as possible om `git.pm` to simplify and be able to benefit from the maintenance of `git.pm`, which probably is more used.

[Patch at my hg repo](http://510x.se/hg/program/ikiwiki/diff/cc73d670bf99/Plugin/mercurial.pm) ([raw format](http://510x.se/hg/program/ikiwiki/raw-file/cc73d670bf99/Plugin/mercurial.pm)).
