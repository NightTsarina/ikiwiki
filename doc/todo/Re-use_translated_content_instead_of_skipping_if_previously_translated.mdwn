    Subject: [PATCH] Re-use translated content instead of skipping if previously
     translated.
    
    This fixes an issue where an initial `inline` directive would be translated
    correctly, but subsequent inlines of the same would result in the raw
    contents of the `.po` file being inserted into the page instead.
    
    For example, given a `index.mdwn` containing:
    
        \[[!inline pages="inline" raw="yes"]]
        \[[!inline pages="inline" raw="yes"]]
    
    .. and an `index.de.po` of:
    
        msgid "\[[!inline pages=\"inline\" raw=\"yes\"]]\n"
        msgstr "\[[!inline pages=\"inline.de\" raw=\"yes\"]]\n"
    
    .. together with an `inline.mdwn` of:
    
       This is inlined content.
    
    .. and an `inline.de.po` of:
    
        msgid "This is inlined content."
        msgstr "This is German inlined content."
    
    .. would result in the following translation:
    
        This is the inlined content.
        # SOME DESCRIPTIVE TITLE
        # Copyright (C) YEAR Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        # This file is distributed under the same license as the PACKAGE package.
        # FIRST AUTHOR <EMAIL@ADDRESS>, YEAR.
    
    .. instead of, of course:
    
        This is the inlined content.
        This is the inlined content.

[[!tag patch]]

> Thank you Chris! I've reviewed the patch (with my "original author of the po plugin" hat on) and it looks good to me. I'm not 100% sure about `alreadyfiltered` being the best name for something that's not a predicated anymore but it's good enough. Then I wore my end-user hat and confirmed that with Chris' patch applied, the reproducer we had for this bug at Tails works fine. So IMO we're good to go and I recommend to apply this patch. Thanks in advance! -- [[intrigeri]]
