Using the Mercurial backend, the lack of `rcs_commit_staged` is noticed
frequently. I couldn't find any tries to update `mercurial.pm`, so not
letting lack of Mercurial AND Perl knowledge bring me down, I copy-pasted
from `git.pm` to mimic its behaviour from a Mercurial perspective. I hope
it can be a foundation for development by those more proficient in
ikiwiki's inner workings. I have doubts that I personally will be able to
revise it more, based on my Perl skills.

I've tested it briefly. `ikiwiki-calendar` and posting of comments now
works with automatic commits, i.e. the `rcs_commit_staged` function works
in those cases. Under my current setup, I don't know where else to expect
it to work. I would be flabberghasted if there wasn't any problems with it,
though.

Diff follows, for anyone to annotate. First code version is also available at [my hg-repo](http://510x.se/hg/program/ikiwiki/file/e741fcfd800f/Plugin/mercurial.pm). Latest version should be [here](http://46.239.104.5:81/hg/program/ikiwiki/file/tip/Plugin/mercurial.pm) ([raw format](http://46.239.104.5:81/hg/program/ikiwiki/raw-file/tip/Plugin/mercurial.pm)). I'll notify on this page with "*Done*" remarks when I've actually commited changes to my local repository. I don't know if I should replace the code and the comments below when I've changed something. I'll probably do this when the code feels more mature. --[[Daniel Andersson]]

A corresponding variable is declared for git. It is unused as of yet for
Mercurial, but when more advanced merge features become available for
`mercurial.pm`, I think it will come into play.

>> It works since `if (! defined $hg_dir)` always hits, and `chdir $config{srcdir}` is well defined. The whole logic is just used in `git.pm` for merge functionality that is not present in `mercurial.pm`, so by the cruft argument above, this should be replaced with just chdir `$config{srcdir}` (which is equivalent to `hg -R` or `hg --cwd` from what I know).

>> I don't know. ["hg stores everything internally as UTF-8, except for pathnames"](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/FE-3198), but output is dependent on the system's locale. The environment variable `HGENCODING=utf-8` can be set to ensure that Mercurial's own output is always UTF-8, but when viewing a diff containing non-UTF-8 changes, the affected lines are nevertheless output in their original encoding. I personally think that this is the correct way to output it, though, unless there is a possibility that someone is running ikiwiki wih a non-UTF-8 locale.

>>> *Done*. I removed the `encode_utf8()` part and instead set `HGENCODING=utf-8` where the external `hg` command was called. It seems to have taken care of "all" character encoding issues (but it is an almost infinite error pool to draw from, so some problem might pop up). --[[Daniel Andersson]]

With the `run_or_{die,cry,non}()` functions defined as in `git.pm`, some old Mercurial functions can be rewritten more compactly.

Here comes the `rcs_commit{,_staged}` part. It is modeled on a `rcs_commit_helper` function, as in `git.pm`.

Some old `mercurial.pm` logic concerning commiter name is kept instead of transplanting the more elaborate logic from `git.pm`. Maybe it is better to "steal" that as well.
