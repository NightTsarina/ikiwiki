[[!tag wishlist]]

I would like to have the possibility for hidden tags or links.
Using the tag functionality I could group some news items for including them into other subpages. But I don't want the links or tags to show (and I don't want Tag lists like "Tags: ?mytag").
The tagged items should not differ from the items, that are not tagged.  
I didn't find any way to hide the tag list or links and I don't want to have to create a "hidden" page containing links to the pages and then using the backlink functionality, because this is more prone to errors. It's easier to forget adding a link on a second page than forgetting to add a needed tag to a new newsitem.  

> I found out, that using the [[meta plugin|plugins/meta]] it is possible to create the hidden link, that I wanted.
