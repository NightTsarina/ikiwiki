I think there is a problem in my "dependency graph". As an example, 
[here](http://poivron.org/~nil/misc/ikiwiki_buggy_index) is the index 
ikiwiki generated for [my site](http://poivron.org/~nil/misc/ikiwiki_buggy_index)
(note that the site changed since this index was generated).

Some **HUGE** dependencies appear, clearly non optimal, like

    depends = A｜ B | A | C | A | D | A | E | A | F | A | G | ....

or 

    depends= A | B | C | D | A | B | C | D | A | B | C | D | ....

Couldn't isolate the cause, but some sources for this problem may be:

* related to the img module
* easily observable in my sire because one of my pages includes 80 resized images

Other special things in my templates and site:

* a sidebar with \[[!include pages="notes/\*" template=foo]] while notes.mdwn has 
  a \[[!include pages="notes/*"]] and uses the sidebar; removed it, doesn't change
* a template (biblio.tmpl) calling the "img" plugin with a template parameter as the
  image filename; removed it, doesn't change
* some strange games with tags whose page calls a "map" directive to show other tags
  shile tags are also used in tagclouds (in the sidebar and in the main pages)
* ...

I observed these problems (same *kind*, I didn't check in details) on
 
* ikiwiki 2.00gpa1 + v5.8.4 + Debian 3.1
* ikiwiki 2.3 + v5.8.8 + Ubuntu 7.04

I can think about reducung the size of my wiki source and making it available online for analysis.

Some questions on your optimize-depends branch. --[[Joey]]

In saveindex it still or'd together the depends list, but the `{depends}`
field seems only useful for backwards compatability (ie, ikiwiki-transition
uses it still), and otherwise just bloats the index.

Is an array the right data structure? `add_depends` has to loop through the
array to avoid dups, it would be better if a hash were used there. Since
inline (and other plugins) explicitly add all linked pages, each as a
separate item, the list can get rather long, and that single add_depends
loop has suddenly become O(N^2) to the number of pages, which is something
to avoid..

Also, since a lot of places are calling add_depends in a loop, it probably
makes sense to just make it accept a list of dependencies to add. It'll be
marginally faster, probably, and should allow for better optimisation
when adding a lot of depends at once.

In Render.pm, we now have a triply nested loop, which is a bit
scary for efficiency. It seems there should be a way to
rework this code so it can use the optimised `pagespec_match_list`,
and/or hoist some of the inner loop calculations (like the `pagename`)
out.

Very good catch on img/meta using the wrong dependency; verified in the wild!
(I've cherry-picked those bug fixes.)

----

Benchmarking results: I benchmarked by altering docwiki.setup to switch off
verbose, running "make clean && ./Makefile.PL && make", and timing one rebuild
of the docwiki followed by three refreshes. Before each refresh I used
`touch plugins/*.mdwn` to have something significant to refresh.

I'm assuming that "user" CPU time is the important thing here (system time was
relatively small in all cases, up to 0.35 seconds per run).

master at the time of rebasing: 14.20s to rebuild, 10.04/12.07/14.01s to
refresh. I think you can see the bug clearly here - the pagespecs are getting
more complicated every time!

After the initial optimization: 14.27s to rebuild, 8.26/8.33/8.26 to refresh.
Success!

Not pre-joining dependencies actually took about ~0.2s more; I don't know why.
I'm worried that duplicates will just build up (again) in less simple cases,
though, so 0.2s is probably a small price to pay for that not happening (it
might well be experimental error, for that matter).

Not saving {depends} to the index, using a hash instead of a list to
de-duplicate, and allowing add_depends to take an arrayref instead of a single
pagespec had no noticable positive or negative effect on this test.

Memoizing the results of pagename brought the rebuild time down to 14.06s
and the refresh time down to 7.96/7.92/7.92, a significant win.

Refactoring to use pagespec_match_list looks more risky from a code churn
point of view; rebuild now takes 14.35s, but refresh is only 7.30/7.29/7.28,
another significant win.
