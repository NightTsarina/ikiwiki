It would rock if I could view diffs from the web without going via feeds. I envision toggle-style buttons on the recentchanges page, or just links to the CGI, which then displays the diff... --[[madduck]]

I have tried to address the issue by adding stuff to the change.tmpl template, but I may be missing something - and it doesn't quite look right:
