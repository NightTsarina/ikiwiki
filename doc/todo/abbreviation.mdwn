We might want some kind of abbreviation and acronym plugin. --[[JoshTriplett]]

 * Not sure if this is what you mean, but I'd love a way to make works which match existing page names automatically like (eg. if there is a page called "MySQL" then any time the word MySQL is mentioned it should become a link to that page).  -- [[AdamShand]]

 * The python-markdown-extras package has support for [abbreviations](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Abbreviations), with the syntax that you just use the abbreviation in text (e.g. HTML) and then define the abbreviations at the end (like "footnote-style" links). For consistency, it might be good to use the same syntax, which apparently derives from [PHP-markdown-extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#abbr).
