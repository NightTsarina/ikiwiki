Here is a patch that makes [[ikiwiki-calendar]] almost useless.

It adds some options, the main one being `calendar_autocreate`, which is
similar to the `tag_autocreate` option of the [[tag|plugins/tag]]: it create
archive pages when needed.

The documentation is updated as well (but as a non-native English speaker, I
won't be offended if you correct stuff you consider awkward):

- [[plugin|https://github.com/paternal/ikiwiki/blob/calendar-autocreate/doc/plugins/calendar.mdwn]]
- [[directive|https://github.com/paternal/ikiwiki/blob/calendar-autocreate/doc/ikiwiki/directive/calendar.mdwn]]
