[[!tag patch patch/core]]

I like the idea of [[tips/integrated_issue_tracking_with_ikiwiki]], and I do so on several wikis.  However, as far as I can tell, ikiwiki has no functionality which can represent dependencies between bugs and allow pagespecs to select based on dependencies.  For instance, I can't write a pagespec which selects all bugs with no dependencies on bugs not marked as done.  --[[JoshTriplett]]

Okie - I've had a quick attempt at this.  Initial patch attached.  This one doesn't quite work.
And there is still a lot of debugging stuff in there.

At the moment I've added a new preprocessor plugin, `definepagespec`, which is like
shortcut for pagespecs.  To reference a named pagespec, use `~` like this:

    [ [!definepagespec name="bugs" spec="bugs/* and !*/Discussion"]]
    [ [!definepagespec name="openbugs" spec="~bugs and !link(done)"]]
    [ [!definepagespec name="readybugs" spec="~openbugs and !link(~openbugs)"]]

At the moment the problem is in `match_link()` when we're trying to find a sub-page that
matches the appropriate page spec.  There is no good list of pages available to iterate over.

    foreach my $nextpage (keys %IkiWiki::pagesources)

does not give me a good list of pages.  I found the same thing when I was working on
this todo [[todo/Add_a_plugin_to_list_available_pre-processor_commands]].

> I'm not sure why iterating over `%pagesources` wouldn't work here, it's the same method

Immediately below is a patch which seems to basically work.  Lots of debugging code is still there
and it needs a cleanup, but I thought it worth posting at this point.  (I was having problems
with old style glob lists, so i just switched them off for the moment.)

The following three inlines work for me with this patch:

    Bugs:
    
    [ [!inline pages="define(~bugs, bugs/* and ! */Discussion) and ~bugs" archive="yes"]]
    
    OpenBugs:
    
    [ [!inline pages="define(~bugs, bugs/* and ! */Discussion) and define(~openbugs,~bugs and !link(done)) and ~openbugs" archive="yes"]]
    
    ReadyBugs:
    
    [ [!inline pages="define(~bugs, bugs/* and ! */Discussion) and define(~openbugs,~bugs and !link(done)) and define(~readybugs,~openbugs and !link(~openbugs)) and ~readybugs" archive="yes"]]

I've lost track of the indent level, so I'm going back to not indented - I think this is a working [[patch]] taking into
account all comments above (which doesn't mean it is above reproach :) ).  --[[Will]]

>> Because you have to define all the named pagespecs in the pagespec, you sometimes end up with very long pagespecs.  I found it useful to split them over multiple lines.  That didn't work at one point and I added the 's' to make it work.  I may have further altered the regex since then to make the 's' redundant.  Remove it and see if multi-line pagespecs still work. :)
