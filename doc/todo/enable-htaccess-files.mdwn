This lets the site administrator have a `.htaccess` file in their underlay
directory, say, then get it copied over when the wiki is built. Without
this, installations that are located at the root of a domain don't get the
benefit of `.htaccess` such as improved directory listings, IP blocking,
URL rewriting, authorisation, etc.

Hi, I would like to have my htaccess files in svn repository so ikiwiki would export that file to my webspace with every commit.

That way I have revision control on that file too. That may be a security concern, but I trust everybody that has svn commit
access and such .htaccess files should not be accessible through wiki cgi. Of course, it could default to 'off'.

bump! I would like to see some form of this functionality included in ikiwiki. I use a patched version, but
its a bit of a PITA to constantly apply it (and to forget sometimes!). I know that security concern is important to consider,
but I use ikiwiki with a very small group of people collaborating so svn/web access is under control
and htaccess is for limiting access to some areas of wiki.   
It should be off by default of course. --Max

+1 I want `.htaccess` so I can rewrite some old Wordpress URLs to make feeds work again. --[[hendry]]

+1 for various purposes (but sometimes the filename isn't `.htaccess`, so please make it configurable) --[[schmonz]]

> I've described a workaround for one use case at the [[plugins/rsync]] [[plugins/rsync/discussion]] page. --[[schmonz]]

[[done]], you can use the `include` setting to override the default
excludes now. Please use extreme caution when doing so. --[[Joey]]
