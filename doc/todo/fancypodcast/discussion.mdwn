# Round 1

## Design

7. For each fancy podcast episode, write a blog post containing
   `\[[!meta enclosure="WikiLink/to/media.mp3"]]`. (Don't specify
   more than one enclosure -- but if you do, last one wins.)
7. When rendering to HTML (single-page or inlined), append a link
   to the media file.
7. When rendering to RSS/Atom, the text is the entry's content and
   the media file is its enclosure.
7. Don't break simple podcasts in pursuit of fancy podcasts.

## Implementation

### Completed

* Cover the existing simple podcast behavior with tests.
* Add an `enclosure` field to [[plugins/meta]] that expands the
  given [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]] to an absolute URL (feed enclosures
  pretty much need to be, and the reference feeds I've looked at
  all do this).
* Write failing tests for the desired single-page and inlined
  HTML behavior, then make them pass by adding enclosure stanzas
  to `{,inline}page.tmpl`.
* Write failing tests for the desired RSS/Atom behavior, then make
  them pass via changes to `{atom,rss}item.tmpl` and [[plugins/inline]].
* Match feature-for-feature with
  [tru_podcast](http://www.rainskit.com/blog/542/tru_podcast-a-podcasting-plugin-for-textpattern)
  (what [[schmonz]] will be migrating from).
* Enrich [feed metadata](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html)
  by catching up `rsspage.tmpl` to `atompage.tmpl`.
* Verify that [[plugins/more]] plays well with fancy podcasts.
* Verify that the feeds validate.
* Subscribe to a fancy feed in some common podcatchers and verify
  display details against a reference podcast.
* Verify smooth transitions for two common use cases (see testing
  details below).
* Code review: don't add enclosure divs unless we have enclosures.
* Code review: genericize download link for more use cases.
* Code review: don't confuse old readers with Atom names in RSS.
* Code review: instead of hacking back to `$link`, just provide it.
* Code review: show author in addition to feedname, if different.

### Code review

	+                               # XXX better way to compute relative to srcdir?
	+                               my $file = $absurl;
	+                               $file =~ s|^$config{url}/||;

I don't think ikiwiki offers a better way to do that, because there is
normally no reason to do that. Why does it need an url of this form here?

	+<TMPL_IF HTML5><section id="inlineenclosure"><TMPL_ELSE><div id="inlineenclosure"></TMPL_IF>
	+<TMPL_IF ENCLOSURE>

Can't we avoid adding this div when there's no enclosure? --[[Joey]]

	+<a href="<TMPL_VAR ENCLOSURE>">Download this episode</a>

"Download this episode" is pretty specific to particular use cases.
Can this be made more generic, perhaps just "Download"? --[[Joey]] 

> Yep, I got a little carried away. Done. --[[schmonz]]

	-<TMPL_IF AUTHOR>
	-       <title><TMPL_VAR AUTHOR ESCAPE=HTML>: <TMPL_VAR TITLE></title>
	-       <dcterms:creator><TMPL_VAR AUTHOR ESCAPE=HTML></dcterms:creator>

This change removes the author name from the title of the rss feed, which
does not seem necessary for fancy podcasts. And it is a change that
could negatively impact eg, Planet style aggregators using ikiwiki. --[[Joey]]

	+++ b/templates/rsspage.tmpl
	+	xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
	+<atom:link href="<TMPL_VAR FEEDURL>" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" />

Why is it using atom namespace inside an rss feed? What are the chances
every crummy rss reader on earth is going to understand this? I'd put it at
about 0%; I doubt ikiwiki's own rss reader understands such a mashup.
