[[!template id=gitbranch branch=wtk/raw_inline author="[[wtk]]"]]

summary
=======

Extend inlining to handle raw files (files with unrecognized extensions).

Also raise an error in `IkiWiki::pagetype($file)` if `$file` is blank, which avoids trying to do much with missing files, etc.

I'm using the new code in my [blog][].

usage
=====

    \[[!inline pagenames="somefile.txt" template="raw" feeds="no"]]
