Information about Multimarkdown 3.X can be found at <http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/>.
Apparently this will run faster because it's not a Perl script.
The markdown plug-in only uses the perl script for multi-markdown.
I see that I could just replace /usr/bin/markdown with a renamed multimarkdown,
but I'd rather not change the system file or uninstall the perl modules.
Perhaps a custom Plugin/mdwn.pm or a clever way to set $markdown_sub would suffice,
but I don't know perl.  If I wanted to replace Plugin/mdwn.pm with something simple
that didn't bother to check for Text::*Markdown, calling /home/me/bin/mymdwn instead,
what would that look like?
