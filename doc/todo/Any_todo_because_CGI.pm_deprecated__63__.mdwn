Is there any current thought of reworking ikiwiki CGI using
any of the suggested [[!cpan CGI::Alternatives]] in response to the
official deprecation of [[!cpan CGI desc=CGI.pm]]?

Or is it just a matter of 'hold course until [[rewrite ikiwiki in haskell]]'?

>> One reason for such a change (although a rewrite in haskell is a little drastic, and overlaps with "gitit") would be to allow ikiwiki to run as a shared thread under FastCGI or mod_perl, instead of forking all the time for every new user. The discussion for this is in [[todo/fastcgi_or_modperl_installation_instructions]] and [[todo/multi-thread_ikiwiki]].

>> Also right now, there are serious lock contention issues in ikiwiki: any `?do=` action in the CGI is under a global lock right now (`lockwiki()`), for example, which makes scaling ikiwiki to multiple editing users a significant problem. I have seen such contention as a user on this wiki but mostly on the git-annex wiki.
