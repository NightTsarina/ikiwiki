I would like to upload a svg figure to illustrate [[this tip|tips/Hosting_Ikiwiki_and_master_git_repository_on_different_machines/]] (this figure would also appear [[here|tips/distributed_wikis]]). 

Unfortunately, Github shows [[raw code|https://github.com/paternal/ikiwiki/blob/paternal/upload-svg/doc/tips/Hosting_Ikiwiki_and_master_git_repository_on_different_machines/separate-web-git-servers.svg]] instead of the image. 

[[!template  id=gitbranch branch=spalax/paternal/upload-svg browse="https://github.com/paternal/ikiwiki/tree/paternal/upload-svg" author="[[Louis|spalax]]"]]

[[!tag patch]]
