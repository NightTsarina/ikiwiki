[[!tag wishlist patch]]

I use a default template for all new pages:

    \[[!meta title="<TMPL_VAR name>"]]
    \[[!meta author=]]
    \[[!meta date="<TMPL_VAR time>"]]
    \[[!meta guid="urn:uuid:<TMPL_VAR uuid>"]]
    \[[!tag ]]

This encourages me to include useful metadata on the page.  In particular, though, I've modified the `edittemplate` plugin to generate a uuid for use in the guid, for use in `inline`.  Importantly, this keeps `inline` from flooding aggregators when I rename these pages.

I've also noticed that IkiWiki seems to use the creation time for the generated page for the page date.  This means that when I do a rebuild, `inline`d pages get shuffled.  The inclusion of a `time` variable in `edittemplate` (and in a `meta` declaration for all such pages) prevents the date from changing unexpectedly.

I've already made these changes in my installation, and have made my patches available in the `edittemplate` branch of git://civilfritz.net/ikiwiki.git.

Changes to the structure of `$pagestate{$registering_page}{edittemplate}{$pagespec}` mean that a `cgi` rebuild is necessary (for reasons I don't entirely understand); but I think that's preferable to creating an entirely separate `$pagestate` namespace for storing parameters.  That said, I'm not really a perl programmer, so corrections are welcome.

>>> Here is a version of that branch that I [[would merge|users/smcv/ready]] if I could.
>>> Changes since Jonathon's version:
>>>
>>> * only generate a UUID if needed
>>> * read `/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid` instead of using [[!cpan UUID::Tiny]]
>>>   if available, to avoid the dependency on at least Linux
>>> * remove v3/v5 UUID support since I don't really see the point,
>>>   and if included, it would need a migration path for `$pagestate`
>>> * use RFC 3339 time format for `time` to make the timezone unambiguous
>>> * add `html_time` which is the output of `IkiWiki::displaytime`, e.g.
>>>   a `<time>` element on HTML5 wikis
>>>
>>> I'm not entirely sure what the use-case is for `formatted_time`,
