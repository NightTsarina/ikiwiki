This is a fleshed out todo based on discussions at
[[forum/managing_todo_lists]].

I would like to have TODO lists inside ikiwiki wikis. This would mean:

* a new markup plugin to support a language suitable for TODO lists (OPML,
  XOXO are two possible candidates)
* some javascript to provide interactive editing.

As [[chrysn]] pointed out on the forum page, this has some crossover with
[[structured page data]]. In particular, if the markup language chosen had a
concept of invalid markup (existing plugins just tend to ignore stuff that
isn't explicitly part of their markup) we would need to sensibly handle that.
Perhaps rejecting web edits and providing context help on why the edit was
rejected, although that sounds like a significant headache.

I have started working on this, albeit slowly. A proof of concept is at
<http://dev.jmtd.net/outliner/>.

There are two git repositories associated with my WIP: one contains the
javascript, the plugin, the changes made to page templates; the other contains
the contents of that wiki-site (so the test todos and the contents of bugs/
which forms a sort-of todo list for the todo list :)) I will endeavour to get
mirrors of those repos up on github or similar asap.
