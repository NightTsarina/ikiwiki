[[!tag patch]]

The [[plugins/opendiscussion]] plugin allows pages named according to
the `discussionpage` setting to be edited anonymously, even if
`discussion => 0` is set.

(If it respected the `discussion` option, the combination of
`opendiscussion` and `moderatedcomments` might be good for blogs.)
