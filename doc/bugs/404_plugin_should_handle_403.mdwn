Apache will return 403 (Forbidden) instead of 404 (Not Found) if the `Indexes` option is turned off.  This is because with `Indexes` turned on, it considers it something it *might* be able to serve in the future.  With `Indexes` off, it will never serve that page in the future (unless `Indexes` is turned back on).

The [[404 plugin|plugins/404]] code only checks for 404, not 403.  It should check for both.
