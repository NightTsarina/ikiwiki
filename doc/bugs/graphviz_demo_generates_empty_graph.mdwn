The following code in our sandbox generates an empty graph:

    [[!graph  src=""""
    google [ href="http://google.com/" ]
    sandbox [ href=\[[SandBox]] ]
    help [ href=\[[ikiwiki/formatting]] ]
    newpage [ href=\[[NewPage]] ]
    
    google -> sandbox -> help -> newpage -> help -> google;
    """"]]

It is the exact same thing that on the [[ikiwiki/directive/graph/]] directive documentation, from the [[plugins/graphviz]] plugin. This is ikiwiki 3.20120203 on Debian wheezy and graphviz is installed (2.26.3-10). Note that the first demo actually works. See <http://mesh.openisp.ca/sandbox>  --[[anarcat]]
