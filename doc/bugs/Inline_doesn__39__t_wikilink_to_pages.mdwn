It seems that the inline directive doesn't generate wikilinks to the pages it includes.  For example I would expect the following to inline all bugs inside this bug report:

\[[!inline pages="bugs/* and !*/discussion and backlink(bugs)" feeds=no postform=no archive=yes show="10"]]

But here it is:

[[!inline pages="bugs/* and !*/discussion and backlink(bugs)" feeds=no postform=no archive=yes show="10"]]

and note that it only included the 'normal' wikilinks (and also note that this page is not marked done even though the done page is inlined).
One might also wonder if inline would make this page link to any internal links on those inlined pages too, but I think
that would be overkill.

I'm not even really sure if this is a bug or defined behaviour, but I thought it might work and it didn't.  Regardless,
the correct behaviour, whichever is decided, should be documented.  -- [[Will]]
