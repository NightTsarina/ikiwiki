since my latest jessie upgrade here, charsets are all broken when editing a page. the page i'm trying to edit is [this wishlist](http://anarc.at/wishlist/), and it used to work fine. now, instead of:

`Voici des choses que vous pouvez m'acheter si vous êtes le Père Nowel (yeah right):`

... as we see in the rendered body right now, when i edit the page i see:

`Voici des choses que vous pouvez m'acheter si vous �tes le P�re Nowel (yeah right):`

... a typical double-encoding nightmare. The actual binary data is this for the word "Père" according to `hd`:

~~~~
anarcat@marcos:ikiwiki$ echo "Père" | hd
00000000  50 c3 a8 72 65 0a                                 |P..re.|
00000006
anarcat@marcos:ikiwiki$ echo "P�re" | hd
00000000  50 ef bf bd 72 65 0a                              |P...re.|

Chromium does seem to auto-detect it as utf8 according to the menus however... not sure what's going on here. I would focus on the following error however, since it's clearly emanating from the CGI... --[[anarcat]]

Clicking on the Cancel button yields the following warning:

However, with some debugging code in Encode.pm, i was able to find a case of double-encoding - in the left menu, for example, which is the source of the Encode.pm crash.

Doing more archeology, it seems that Encode.pm is indeed where the problem started, all the way back in [commit 8005a82](https://github.com/dankogai/p5-encode/commit/8005a82d8aa83024d72b14e66d9eb97d82029eeb#diff-f3330aa405ffb7e3fec2395c1fc953ac) (august 2013), taken from [pull request #11](https://github.com/dankogai/p5-encode/pull/11) which expressively forbids double-decoding, in effect failing like python does in the above example you gave (Perl used to silently succeed instead, a rather big change if you ask me).

The apache logs yield:

Interestingly enough, I can't reproduce the bug here (at least in this page). Also, editing the page through git works fine.

I had put ikiwiki on hold during the last upgrade, so it was upgraded separately. The bug happens both with 3.20140613 and 3.20140831. The major thing that happened today is the upgrade from perl 5.18 to 5.20. Here's the output of `egrep '[0-9] (remove|purge|install|upgrade)' /var/log/dpkg.log | pastebinit -b paste.debian.net` to give an idea of what was upgraded today:

http://paste.debian.net/plain/119944

This is a major bug which should probably be fixed before jessie, yet i can't seem to find a severity statement in reportbug that would justify blocking the release based on this - unless we consider non-english speakers as "most" users (i don't know the demographics well enough). It certainly makes ikiwiki completely unusable for my users that operate on the web interface in french... --[[anarcat]]

Note that on this one page, i can't even get the textarea to display and i immediately get `Error: Cannot decode string with wide characters at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20/Encode.pm line 215`: http://anarc.at/ikiwiki.cgi?do=edit&page=hardware%2Fserver%2Fmarcos.

Also note that this is the same as [[forum/"Error: cannot decode string with wide characters" on Mageia Linux x86-64 Cauldron]], I believe. The backtrace I get here is:

~~~~

so this would explain the error on cancel, but doesn't explain the weird encoding i get when editing the page... <sigh>...

... and that leads me to this crazy patch which fixes all the above issue, by avoiding double-decoding... go figure that shit out...
