I created [[sandbox/revert me]] and then tried the revert button on
[[•	Get_CAll_@_1*855.709~2847_@_E.p.s.o.n_P.r.i.n.t.e.r_T.e.c.h.n.i.c.a.l_S.u.p.p.o.r.t_C.o.n.t.a.c.t_N.u.m.b.e.r]], but I was not allowed to revert it. The specific error
was

    Error: you are not allowed to change sandbox/revert_me.mdwn

I've just tried reading through the revert code, and I haven't figured out
what permission I am lacking.  Perhaps the error message could be a little
clearer on that. The error might have been thrown by git_parse_changes in
git.pm or check_canchange in IkiWiki.pm, via IkiWiki::Receive. -- Jon
