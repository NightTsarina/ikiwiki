Adding text of the format 

    Apple
    :   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
        the family Rosaceae.
    :   An american computer company.

    Orange
    :   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

Does not result in expected HTML as described in the [MultiMarkdown Syntax Guide](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/users_guide/multimarkdown_syntax_guide/):

Should be 

    <dl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <dt>Apple</dt>
     <dd>
       <p>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
          the family Rosaceae.</p>
     </dd>
     <dd>
       <p>An american computer company.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Orange</dt>
     <dd>
      <p>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</p>
     </dd>
    </dl>

But instead it gives:

    <p>Apple
     :   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
         the family Rosaceae.
     :   An american computer company.</p>

    <p>Orange
    :   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</p>
