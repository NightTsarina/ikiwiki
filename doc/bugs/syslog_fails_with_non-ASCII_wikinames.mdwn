[[!template  id=gitbranch branch=anarcat/syslog_utf8 author="[[anarcat]]"]]

[[this feature|todo/syslog_should_show_wiki_name]] made it so syslog doesn't work anymore if the site being logged has non-ASCII characters it in.

Specifically, my wiki was named "CⒶTS", and nothing was showing up in syslog. When I changed that to "C@TS", it worked again.

My guess is this sits somewhere here:

[[!format perl """
		return eval {
			Sys::Syslog::syslog($type, "[$config{wikiname}] %s", join(" ", @_));
		};
"""]]

Yet I am not sure how to fix that kind of problem in Perl... --[[anarcat]]

I can also confirm that  reverting [[todo/syslog_should_show_wiki_name]] fixes the bug. Finally, I have a unit test that reproduces the problem in git, and a working [[!taglink patch]] for the bug, again in git.

For example, the [[plugins/notifyemail]] plugin will silently fail to send notifications if the pages contain unicode. The [[plugins/notifychanges]] plugin I am working on (in [[todo/option to send only the diff in notifyemail]]) seems to be working around the issue so far, but there's no telling which similar problem are out there.
