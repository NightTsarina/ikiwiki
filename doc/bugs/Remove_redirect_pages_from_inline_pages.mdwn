I accidentally made a typo spelling "surprises" and changed my URL from

<http://natalian.org/archives/2012/12/04/Singapore_banking_suprises/>
to
<http://natalian.org/archives/2012/12/04/Singapore_banking_suprises/>

Using the meta redir. However the meta redir now appears in the index of <http://natalian.org/>

Any ideas how to handle this situation?
