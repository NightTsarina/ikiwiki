[[ikiwiki/directive/linkmap]]s display the file name instead of the pagetitle, showing unsightly underscore escapes and underscores instead of blanks to users.

the attached [[!taglink patch]] fixes this; from its commit message:

    display the pagetitle() in linkmaps
    
    without this patch, linkmaps display underscores and underscore escape
    sequences in the rendered output.
    
    this introduces a pageescape function, which invoces pagetitle() to get
    rid of underscore escapes and wraps the resulting utf8 string
    appropriately for inclusion in a dot file (using dot's html encoding
    because it can represent the '\"' dyad properly, and because it doesn't
    need special-casing of newlines).
