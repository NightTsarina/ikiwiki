If I make a comment from an ipv4 address
I see the commenter's ipv4 address logged in the comment file.

If I make a comment from an ipv6 address
I see nothing.

There is a sanity check in /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/comments.pm
line 447 (according to today's version) there is an ipv4 specific regexp.

I removed the regexp and used the value without this added check and it fixed
the problem for me. Not sure if this is the best solution. --[[cstamas]]
