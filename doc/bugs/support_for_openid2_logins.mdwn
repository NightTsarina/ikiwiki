I have several complaints that users cannot contribute to my ikiwiki instances since they only have OpenID logins that support OpenID2. E.g. Yahoo!'s OpenID only supports 2.0+ 

This is not the fault of ikiwiki, though the problem lies within the [perl openid consumer](http://packages.qa.debian.org/libn/libnet-openid-consumer-perl.html) in Debian which is a 1.x implementation AFAIK.

I've contacted JanRain who have pointed me to:

* [OpenID4Perl](http://code.sxip.com/openid4perl/)
* Some [work](http://code.sixapart.com/svn/openid/trunk/perl/) by David Recordon

However both Perl OpenID 2.x implementations have not been released and are incomplete implementations. :(

## A quick fix for the impatient running stable is simply `sudo apt-get install libnet-openid-consumer-perl -t unstable`
