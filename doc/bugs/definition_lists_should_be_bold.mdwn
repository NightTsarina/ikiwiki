Definition lists do not look great here...

Here is an example.

<dl>
<dt>this is a term</dt>
<dd>and this is its definition.</dd>
</dl>

(This wiki doesn't support Markdown's extended definition lists, but still, this is valid markup.)

I believe `<dt>` should be made bold. I have added this to my `local.css`, and I would hate to add this all the time forever:

    /* definition lists look better with the term in bold */
    dt
    {
        font-weight: bold;
    }

:) How does that look? I can provide a patch for the base wiki if you guys really want... ;) -- [[anarcat]]
