I'm trying to put a list of tags in a table, so I carefully make a newline-free taglist.tmpl and then do:

    | \[[!inline pages="link(/category/env)" feeds=no archive=yes sort=title template=taglist]] |

but there's a line in `inline.pm` that does:

    return "&lt;div class=\"inline\" id=\"$#inline\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n";

And the extra newlines break the table.  Can they be safely removed?
