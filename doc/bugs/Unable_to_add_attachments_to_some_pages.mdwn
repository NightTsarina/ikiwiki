# Unable to add attachments to some pages

I can add attachment to some pages within an ikiwiki site. ( for example the index page ), but I'm unable to add attachments to other child pages.

When I try I get the error message "Error: bad attachment filename".  I can successfully attach the same file to the index page.

I'm running

ikiwiki version 3.20100815.7 on Debian Squeeze.

Please advise.
