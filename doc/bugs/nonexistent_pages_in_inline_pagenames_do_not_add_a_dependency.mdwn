Potential ways this could be addressed:

* Add a presence dependency on everything the reference could match:
  so if the `inline` is on `a/b/c` and the missing page is `m`,
  add a `$depends_simple` `$DEPEND_PRESENCE` dependency on `a/b/c/m`,
  `a/b/m`, `a/m`, `m` and (if configured) `$config{userdir}/m`

* Make the page names in `\[[!inline pagenames=...]]` count as wikilinks,
  changing the behaviour of `link()` and backlinks, but causing appropriate
  rebuilds via the special cases in `IkiWiki::Render`

* Extend the special cases in `IkiWiki::Render` to consider a superset of
  wikilinks, to which `pagenames` would add its named pages, without
  affecting `link()` and backlinks

(Note that `\[[!inline pages=...]]` cannot count as wikilinks, because
pagespecs can contain `link()`, so can't be evaluated until we know what
wikilinks exist, at which point it's too late to add more wikilinks.)

I think the presence dependency is probably the cleanest approach?
