On the home page of my wiki, when i click on the link "ikiwiki", i get the english file instead of the french file.  
At the bottom of this page, there is the "Links" line:  
Links: index index.fr templates templates.fr  
When i click on "templates.fr", i get the po.file instead of html.  
   
    Sorry for the noise! I set "po_master_language" to fr and all was ok. [[done]].

>> I can reproduce the bug with:  
 	# po plugin  
	# master language (non-PO files)  
	po_master_language => {  
	  code => 'en',  
	  name => 'English'  
	},  
	# slave languages (PO files)  
	po_slave_languages => [qw{fr|Français}],
