I seem to have broken Discussion page creation links. --[[Joey]] 

For the toplevel, it needs to save to index/discussion. index/Discussion
or Discussion won't work. It defaults to Discussion on the toplevel.
And this is particularly bad as it breaks all other discussion links on
other pages.

For other pages, it should save to page/discussion. page/Discussion does
not work. And it defaults to Discussion which is just *wrong*.
