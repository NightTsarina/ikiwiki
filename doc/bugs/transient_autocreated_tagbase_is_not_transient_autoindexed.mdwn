Shouldn't `ikiwiki-tag-test/raw/.ikiwiki/transient/tag.mdwn` and `ikiwiki-tag-test/rendered/tag/index.html` exist?

> To have a starting point to (maybe) change this, my `ready/autoindex`
> branch adds a regression test for the current behaviour, both with
> and without `autoindex_commit` enabled. It also fixes an unnecessary
> and potentially harmful special case for the transient directory.
>
> The fact that files in underlays (including transient files) don't
> trigger autoindexing is deliberate. However, this is the second
> request to change this behaviour: the first was
> [[!debbug 611068]], which has a patch from Tuomas Jormola.
> On that bug report, Joey explains why it's undesirable
> for the original behaviour of autoindex (when the
> index isn't transient).
>
> I'm not sure whether the same reasoning still applies when the
> index is transient, though (`autoindex_commit => 0`),
> because the index pages won't be cluttering up people's
> git repositories any more? My `autoindex-more` branch changes
> the logic so it will do what you want in the `autoindex_commit => 0`
> case, and amends the appropriate regression test. --[[smcv]]
