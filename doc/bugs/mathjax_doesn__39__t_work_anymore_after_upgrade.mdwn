After my upgrade from ubuntu 14.04 to 15.04 mathjax stopped working in my ikiwiki. Math is displayed correctly for pages created before the upgrade. For new pages or if I change an old page, math is not rendered but the LaTeX source code is printed (with \[ \] as deliminiters instead of $$ $$). 

Any idea what may be wrong here and how to fix it?

I installed mathjax via the pandoc-iki plugin as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8444409/406686)

The rebuild of an old site containing math is missing the following lines:


     <script src="/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full" type="text/javascript"></script>
     </head>
     <body>
     <noscript>
     <div style="color:#CC0000; text-align:center">
     <b>Warning: <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>
     requires JavaScript to process the mathematics on this page.<br>
     If your browser supports JavaScript, be sure it is enabled.</b>
     </div>
     <hr>
     </noscript>

----------------------

I finally noticed that the `page.tmpl` was messed up. It seams that the upgrade deleted the relevant `mathjax` line. Adding this makes it work again. Thanks!
