Some elements of
[HTML5](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/) can be
safely supported by ikiwiki. There are [several differences between HTML4 and
HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/).

* [HTML5 branch](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=ikiwiki;h=refs/heads/html5)
* [ikiwiki instance with HTML5 templates](http://natalian.org)

# HTML5 Validation and t/html.t

[validator.nu](http://validator.nu/) is the authorative HTML5 validator,
however it is almost impossible to sanely introduce as a build dependency
because of its insane Java requirements. :( I test locally via
[cURL](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IDE), though Debian packages cannot be built
with a network dependency.

In the future, hopefully ikiwiki can test for valid HTML5 using [Relax NG
schema](http://syntax.whattf.org/) using a Debian package tool
[rnv](http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/rnv.html).

# HTML5 migration issues

# [article](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#the-article-element) element

This element is poorly supported by browsers. As a workaround, `style.css` needs:

	article {
		display: block;
	}

Internet Explorer will display it as a block, though you can't seem to be further control the style.

# Validator complains with no h1-h6 in header

* [#509](http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=509)

## Time element

The [time element](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element) ideally needs the datatime= attribute set by a template variable with what [HTML5 defines as a valid datetime string](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#valid-global-date-and-time-string).

As a workaround:

	au:~% grep timeformat natalian.setup
	timeformat => '%Y-%m-%d',
