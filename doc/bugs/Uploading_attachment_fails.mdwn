I just upgraded from ubuntu 14.04 to ubuntu 15.04. Since then uploading attachments using the attachment plugin doesn't work anymore in ikiwiki. It prints a "failed!" message. Any idea what may be wrong here and how to fix it?

ikiwiki version 3.20141016.2

`/var/log/apache2/error.log`

gives this:

Died at `/usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/CGI.pm line 497`.

Thanks, I just opened a bug r[eport on launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ikiwiki/+bug/1470391). For the workaround. How do I use the older version of CGI.pm? Is this done automatically if I remove libcgi-pm-perl?
