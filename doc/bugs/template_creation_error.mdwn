Hi,
I am trying to build a template. The compilation of this template results in a weird exception. I have isolated the cause of the exception to the following point:

If i have this in the template code:

\[[!inline<br/>
pages="\<TMPL_VAR SEL_PAGES\>"<br/>
template=extract-entry<br/>
\]]<br/>

There is no problem at all. I can use the template with the desired result. But if I try to use this (just adding the "show" parameter):

\[[!inline <br/>
pages="\<TMPL_VAR SEL_PAGES>"<br/>
template=extract-entry<br/>
show=\<TMPL_VAR CNTPG><br/>
\]]<br/>

I get this exception on the Git bash console:

<pre>

Please, let me know what to do to avoid this kind of error.
