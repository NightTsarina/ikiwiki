I've tried to retrieve the wmd-editor source tarball lately, but the site seems offline.

From what I've read on the Internet, wmd-editor is not (yet?) free software by itself, and its author has gone MIA.
But it looks like somebody recently took the step to rewrite a wmd-clone under a saner license, see [[pagedown|http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/source/browse/]].

Given all the above, what about upgrading this plugin to use pagedown instead of wmd? It seem a clear win to me... --(unsigned)

Other conversations:
