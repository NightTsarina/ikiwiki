Isn't this functionality a part of what [[plugins/toc]] needs and does? Then probably the [[plugins/toc]] plugin's code could be split into the part that implements the [[plugins/headinganchors]]'s functionality and the TOC generation itself. That will bring more order into the code and the set of available plugins. --Ivan Z.

> Indeed it is. Except [[plugins/toc]] generates headings differently - and independently of this. *Even* if [[toc]]'s functionality would be split, you'd probably want to retain backwards compatibility there, so it's unlikely that this will happen... Also see [[todo/toc-with-human-readable-anchors]]. --[[anarcat]]

I think using this below would let the source html clear for the browser
without changing the render:

        #use URI::Escape
        .
        .

        #$str = uri_escape_utf8($str);
        $str = Encode::decode_utf8($str);
        #$str =~ s/%/./g;

Don't you think ?
