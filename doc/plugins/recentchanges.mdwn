[[!tag type/meta]]

This plugin examines the [[revision_control_system|rcs]] history and
generates a page describing each recent change made to the wiki. These
pages can be joined together with [[inline]] to generate the
[[RecentChanges]] page.

This plugin also currently handles web-based reversion of changes.

Typically only the RecentChanges page will use the pages generated by this
plugin, but you can use it elsewhere too if you like. It's used like this:

	\[[!inline pages="internal(recentchanges/change_*)"
	template=recentchanges show=0]]

Here's an example of how to show only changes to "bugs/*".
This matches against the title of the change, which includes a list of
modified pages.

	\[[!inline pages="internal(recentchanges/change_*) and title(*bugs/*)"
	template=recentchanges show=0]]

Here's an example of how to show only changes that Joey didn't make.
(Joey commits sometimes as user `joey`, and sometimes via openid.)
	
	\[[!inline pages="internal(recentchanges/change_*) and
	!author(joey) and !author(http://joey.kitenet.net*)"
	template=recentchanges show=0]]

If you want to generate feeds for the RecentChanges page, you have to use
[[`rss`_or_`atom`_in_the_setup_file|/todo/minor adjustment to setup documentation for recentchanges feeds]].
