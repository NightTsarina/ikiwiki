# Created_in_future

This plugin provides a `created_in_future()` [[PageSpec|ikiwiki/pagespec/]]
function. It matches pages which have a creation date in the future.

It also sets the date of the next modification of the page on its creation
date, so that the corresponding page (and the pages referring to it) will be
rebuilt on the relevant call of `ikiwiki`.

## Usage

It can be used to display a list of upcoming events.

	\[[!inline pages="events/* and created_in_future()" reverse=yes sorted=meta(date)]]
