IkiWiki plugin to send PURGE requests to remote http cache server (like Varnish Cache) when your content changes.

PURGE requests are sent for the changed page, as well as all pages indirectly changed when ikiwiki rebuilds the web pages.

# Download

Download from [Github](https://github.com/ssm/ikiwiki-plugin-purge)

# Configure ikiwiki

    # purge_url (mandatory), the address of your cache server.
    purge_url: http://example.com/

    # purge_timeout (optional, default 5) timeout in seconds for a purge request.

    # purge_method (optional, default "PURGE") HTTP method to use.
    
# Configure your cache server

For Varnish, you'll need to add a handler for the non-standard "PURGE" method, and preferrably an ACL which restricts who can send these requests to empty your cache.

    acl origin_server {
        "localhost";
        "192.0.2.0"/24;
        "2001:db8::"/64;
    }
 
    sub vcl_recv {
        if (req.method == "PURGE") {
            if (!client.ip ~ origin_server) {
                return(synth(405,"Not allowed."));
            }
            return (purge);
        }
    }
