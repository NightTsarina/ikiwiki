Summary
=======

A plugin for handling files written in [org-mode][].

A complete rewrite of the plugin can be found
[here][chrismgray-rewrite].  It uses a
dedicated emacs instance to parse the org-mode files.  Thus, it should
be a bit faster than the older plugin, as well as properly handling
[[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]] and images, two features not present in the older
plugin.  An example of its use can be found at my [blog][chrismgray-blog].

Original plugin
===============

This is an updated form of [Manoj Srivastava's plugin][MS].  You can
see the plugin [in action][example] on my blog.

For reasons discussed in the [[reStructuredText plugin|plugins/rst]],
wikilinks and other ikiwiki markup that inserts raw HTML can cause
problems.  Org-mode provides a [means for processing raw HTML][raw],
but Ikiwiki currently (as far as I know) lacks a method to escape
inserted HTML depending on which plugins will be used during the
[[htmlize phase|plugins/write#index11h3]].
