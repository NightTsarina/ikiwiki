thanks for this plugin.  it might help me in my application, which is to provide album/galleries which can be edited (ie. new images added, taken away, etc.) through web interface.

i have two challenges: firstly, for installation, i'm not sure what all the files are that need to be downloaded (because of my setup i can't easily pull the repo).  so far i have Ikiwiki/Plugins/album.pm; ikiwiki-album; and 4 files in templates/  any others?

secondly: barring the CGI interface for editing the album, which would be great, is there at least a way to use attachment plugin or any other to manually add images and then create viewers for them?

You had wanted my feedback on the design of this. I have not looked at the
code or tried it yet, but here goes. --[[Joey]]	

* Needing to create the albumimage "viewer" pages for each photo
  seems like it will become a pain. Everyone will need to come up
  with their own automation for it, and then there's the question
  of how to automate it when uploading attachments. -J

  earlier! -J

>>> I do use img. -s

* And doesn't each viewer page really depend on every other page in the
  same albumsection? If a new page is added, the next/prev links
  may need to be updated, for example. If so, there will be much
  unnecessary rebuilding. -J

* Seems possibly backwards that the albumimage controls what album
  an image appears in. Two use cases -- 1: I may want to make a locked
  album, but then anyone who can write to any other page on the wiki can
  add an image to it. 2: I may want an image to appear in more than one
  album. Think tags. So it seems it would be better to have the album
  directive control what pages it includes (a la inline). -J

* Putting a few of the above thoughts together, my ideal album system
  seems to be one where I can just drop the images into a directory and
  have them appear in the album index, as well as each generate their own wiki
  page. Plus some way I can, later, edit metadata for captions,
  etc. (Real pity we can't just put arbitrary metadata into the images
  themselves.) This is almost pointing toward making the images first-class
  wiki page sources. Hey, it worked for po! :) But the metadata and editing
  problems probably don't really allow that. -J

'''I think the "special extension" design is a dead-end, but here's what
happened when I tried to work out how it would work. --[[smcv]]'''

Suppose that each viewer is a JPEG-or-GIF-or-something, with extension
".albumimage". We have a gallery "memes" with three images, badger,
mushroom and snake.

> An alternative might be to use ".album.jpg", and ".album.gif"

>> foo.albumjpg (etc.) for images, and foo._albummeta (with
>> `keepextension => 1`) for sidecar metadata files, seems viable. -s

Files in git repo:

* index.mdwn
* memes.mdwn
* memes/badger.albumjpg (a renamed JPEG)
* memes/badger/comment_1._comment
* memes/badger/comment_2._comment
* memes/mushroom.albumgif (a renamed GIF)
* memes/mushroom._albummeta (sidecar file with metadata)
* memes/snake.albummov (a renamed video)

Files in web content:

* index.html
* memes/index.html
* memes/96x96-badger.jpg (from img)
* memes/96x96-mushroom.gif (from img)
* memes/96x96-snake.jpg (from img, hacked up to use totem-video-thumbnailer :-) )
* memes/badger/index.html (including comments)
* memes/badger.jpg
* memes/mushroom/index.html
* memes/mushroom.gif
* memes/snake/index.html
* memes/snake.mov

ispage("memes/badger") (etc.) must be true, to make the above rendering
happen, so albumimage needs to be a "page" extension.

To not confuse other plugins, album should probably have a filter() hook
that turns .albumimage files into HTML? That'd probably be a reasonable
way to get them rendered anyway.

do=edit&page=memes/badger needs to not put the JPG in a text box: somehow
divert or override the normal edit CGI by telling it that .albumimage
files are not editable in the usual way?

Every image needs to depend on, and link to, the next and previous images,
which is a bit tricky. In previous thinking about this I'd been applying
the overly strict constraint that the ordered sequence of pages in each
album must be known at scan time. However, that's not *necessarily* needed:
the album and each photo could collect an unordered superset of dependencies
at scan time, and at rebuild time that could be refined to be the exact set,
in order.

Perhaps restricting to "the images in an album A must match A/*"
would be useful; then the unordered superset could just be "A/*". Your
"albums via tags" idea would be nice too though, particularly for feature
parity with e.g. Facebook: "photos of Joey" -> "tags/joey and albumimage()"
maybe?

If images are allowed to be considered to be part of more than one album,
then a pretty and usable UI becomes harder - "next/previous" expands into
"next photo in holidays/2009/germany / next photo in tagged/smcv / ..."
and it could get quite hard to navigate. Perhaps next/previous links could
be displayed only for the closest ancestor (in URL space) that is an
album, or something?

> Ugh, yeah, that is a problem. Perhaps wanting to support that was just
> too ambitious. --[[Joey]] 

>> I propose to restrict to having images be subpages of albums, as
>> described above. -s

Requiring renaming is awkward for non-technical Windows/Mac users, with both
platforms' defaults being to hide extensions; however, this could be
circumvented by adding some sort of hook in attachment to turn things into
a .albumimage at upload time, and declaring that using git/svn/... without
extensions visible is a "don't do that then" situation :-)

> Or extend `pagetype` so it can do the necessary matching without

Ideally attachment could also be configured to upload into a specified
underlay, so that photos don't have to be in your source-code control
(you might want that, but I don't!).

Things that would be nice, and are probably possible:

* make the "Edit page" link on viewers divert to album-specific CGI instead
  of just failing or not appearing (probably possible via pagetemplate)

* some way to deep-link to memes/badger.jpg with a wikilink, without knowing a
  priori that it's secretly a JPEG (probably harder than it looks - you'd
  have to make a directive for it and it's probably not worth it)

Hi smcv, great plugin. I am an ikiwiki newbie but so far I've had success using your plugin.
I've integrated the jquery masonry plugin into the albumitem template and it works great.
But is there a way to create thumnails of different sizes? I've passed thumnailsize option
and value to album directive and while it does create the new thumbnail sizes it doesn't use them,
The 96x96 thumbnails still appear on the page no matter what I do. - jaime

----

Hi, the plugin looks great, but I am probably too dumb to use it ;( here is what I did:
created page gal.mdwn with just \[\[!album\]\] directive (no arguments) and subdirectory gal/ with images in form img_1234.jpg

when I run ikiwiki, I get something completely wrong though:

generated gal/index.html page contains following code repeated for every image:

    <div class="album-viewer">
      <div id="album-img">
        <div class="album-finish">
          <a href="./"><span class="album-arrow">â†‘</span></a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

So no links to any images, etc.

The pages for individual images are generated though, but also not correct. Trails section is perfect, but the main part is wrong:

    <div class="album-prev">
      <a><span class="album-arrow">â†<90></span></a><br />
      <div class="album-thumbnail">
        <span class="selflink">
          <img src="./96x96-img_2913.jpg" width="96" height="72" alt="img 2913" title="img 2913" class="img" /></span>
      </div>
    </div>

This really seems like this should be in the album page and not individul page. It is only thumbnail and not full image. Also the full image is not in the generated html tree at all!

I am using ikiwiki 3.20130518, and got the album sources from the links of [this page](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/contrib/album/) (part manual installation)

Any hint about what do I do wrong?

Thanks Lukas

Hi smcv, we spoke on irc the other day. Passed `show => "0"` on line 126 in album.pm to remove the limit on the thumbnails shown on the album page. Setting it on the album directive didn't work. As mentioned above by Jaime setting the thumbnailsize doesn't catch either. Or rather if I git push after changing the album directive the generated thumbnails (the image files) are the correct size as set in the directive. The html however uses the default thumbnailsize as hardcoded in album.pm and has broken thumbnails as it links to a file with the default size in the filename.

Issuing `ikiwiki --rebuild` knocks the system into another gear where the thumbnails show up correctly but this is only due to the html being the same as above (linking to hardcoded thumbnailsize) but the generated thumbnail images are now matching the hardcoded size ignoring the thumbnailsize attribute on the album directive.

For me this behaviour is way beyond my skills to sort out (I'm no coder). The albumplugin ikiwiki combo is very attractive to me and the plugin i soo close to working!

I've changed the behavior of the "slideshow" to show the next image when clicking the large image as downloading a full resolution image is a rare use case in a gallery of this type imho. The large clicktarget means you are likely to unnecessarily download large files otherwise. I can't quite follow the template, album.pm flow so I can't figure out how to put a "download full resolution" link on the viewer page which would be my next step. To achieve the next link i added ` link => ($nextpage or $album),` around line 454 in `my $img`

My wishlist for the plugin would include:

- Reading exif info from the imagefile
- Keeping the full resolution image files out of version control
- Being able to create new albums by tag or bym anually picking images from other albums. Could be a simple comma separated list of viewer names, or even full urls, in the album directive.
