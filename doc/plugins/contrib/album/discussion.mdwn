## installation queries from brush

thanks for this plugin.  it might help me in my application, which is to provide album/galleries which can be edited (ie. new images added, taken away, etc.) through web interface.

i have two challenges: firstly, for installation, i'm not sure what all the files are that need to be downloaded (because of my setup i can't easily pull the repo).  so far i have Ikiwiki/Plugins/album.pm; ikiwiki-album; and 4 files in templates/  any others?

secondly: barring the CGI interface for editing the album, which would be great, is there at least a way to use attachment plugin or any other to manually add images and then create viewers for them?

## design feedback from joeyh on an earlier version

You had wanted my feedback on the design of this. I have not looked at the
code or tried it yet, but here goes. --[[Joey]]	

* Needing to create the albumimage "viewer" pages for each photo
  seems like it will become a pain. Everyone will need to come up
  with their own automation for it, and then there's the question
  of how to automate it when uploading attachments. -J

* With each viewer page having next/prev links, I can see how you
  were having the scalability issues with ikiwiki's data structures
  earlier! -J

>>> I do use img. -s

* And doesn't each viewer page really depend on every other page in the
  same albumsection? If a new page is added, the next/prev links
  may need to be updated, for example. If so, there will be much
  unnecessary rebuilding. -J

* Seems possibly backwards that the albumimage controls what album

  album, but then anyone who can write to any other page on the wiki can
  add an image to it. 2: I may want an image to appear in more than one
  album. Think tags. So it seems it would be better to have the album
  directive control what pages it includes (a la inline). -J

* Putting a few of the above thoughts together, my ideal album system

  etc. (Real pity we can't just put arbitrary metadata into the images
  themselves.) This is almost pointing toward making the images first-class
  wiki page sources. Hey, it worked for po! :) But the metadata and editing
  problems probably don't really allow that. -J

## alternative "special extension" design (conclusion: "don't")

'''I think the "special extension" design is a dead-end, but here's what
happened when I tried to work out how it would work. --[[smcv]]'''

[[!toggle id="special-extension-sketch" text="show"]]
[[!toggleable id="special-extension-sketch" text="""
[[!toggle id="special-extension-sketch" text="hide"]]

Suppose that each viewer is a JPEG-or-GIF-or-something, with extension
".albumimage". We have a gallery "memes" with three images, badger,
mushroom and snake.

> An alternative might be to use ".album.jpg", and ".album.gif"
> etc as the htmlize extensions. May need some fixes to ikiwiki to support
> that. --[[Joey]] 

>> foo.albumjpg (etc.) for images, and foo._albummeta (with
>> `keepextension => 1`) for sidecar metadata files, seems viable. -s

Files in git repo:

* index.mdwn
* memes.mdwn
* memes/badger.albumjpg (a renamed JPEG)
* memes/badger/comment_1._comment
* memes/badger/comment_2._comment
* memes/mushroom.albumgif (a renamed GIF)
* memes/mushroom._albummeta (sidecar file with metadata)
* memes/snake.albummov (a renamed video)

Files in web content:

* index.html
* memes/index.html
* memes/96x96-badger.jpg (from img)
* memes/96x96-mushroom.gif (from img)
* memes/96x96-snake.jpg (from img, hacked up to use totem-video-thumbnailer :-) )
* memes/badger/index.html (including comments)
* memes/badger.jpg
* memes/mushroom/index.html
* memes/mushroom.gif
* memes/snake/index.html
* memes/snake.mov

ispage("memes/badger") (etc.) must be true, to make the above rendering
happen, so albumimage needs to be a "page" extension.

To not confuse other plugins, album should probably have a filter() hook
that turns .albumimage files into HTML? That'd probably be a reasonable
way to get them rendered anyway.

do=edit&page=memes/badger needs to not put the JPG in a text box: somehow
divert or override the normal edit CGI by telling it that .albumimage
files are not editable in the usual way?

Every image needs to depend on, and link to, the next and previous images,
which is a bit tricky. In previous thinking about this I'd been applying
the overly strict constraint that the ordered sequence of pages in each
album must be known at scan time. However, that's not *necessarily* needed:
the album and each photo could collect an unordered superset of dependencies
at scan time, and at rebuild time that could be refined to be the exact set,
in order.

Perhaps restricting to "the images in an album A must match A/*"
would be useful; then the unordered superset could just be "A/*". Your
"albums via tags" idea would be nice too though, particularly for feature
parity with e.g. Facebook: "photos of Joey" -> "tags/joey and albumimage()"
maybe?

If images are allowed to be considered to be part of more than one album,
then a pretty and usable UI becomes harder - "next/previous" expands into
"next photo in holidays/2009/germany / next photo in tagged/smcv / ..."
and it could get quite hard to navigate. Perhaps next/previous links could
be displayed only for the closest ancestor (in URL space) that is an
album, or something?

> Ugh, yeah, that is a problem. Perhaps wanting to support that was just
> too ambitious. --[[Joey]] 

>> I propose to restrict to having images be subpages of albums, as
>> described above. -s

Requiring renaming is awkward for non-technical Windows/Mac users, with both
platforms' defaults being to hide extensions; however, this could be
circumvented by adding some sort of hook in attachment to turn things into
a .albumimage at upload time, and declaring that using git/svn/... without
extensions visible is a "don't do that then" situation :-)

> Or extend `pagetype` so it can do the necessary matching without

Ideally attachment could also be configured to upload into a specified
underlay, so that photos don't have to be in your source-code control
(you might want that, but I don't!).

Things that would be nice, and are probably possible:

* make the "Edit page" link on viewers divert to album-specific CGI instead
  of just failing or not appearing (probably possible via pagetemplate)

* some way to deep-link to memes/badger.jpg with a wikilink, without knowing a
  priori that it's secretly a JPEG (probably harder than it looks - you'd
  have to make a directive for it and it's probably not worth it)

### bug: unable to vary thumbnail size

Hi smcv, great plugin. I am an ikiwiki newbie but so far I've had success using your plugin.
I've integrated the jquery masonry plugin into the albumitem template and it works great.
But is there a way to create thumnails of different sizes? I've passed thumnailsize option
and value to album directive and while it does create the new thumbnail sizes it doesn't use them,
The 96x96 thumbnails still appear on the page no matter what I do. - jaime

> Fixed in album5 branch, thanks to [[KathrynAndersen]]. --[[smcv]]

----

### failed installation

Hi, the plugin looks great, but I am probably too dumb to use it ;( here is what I did:
created page gal.mdwn with just \[\[!album\]\] directive (no arguments) and subdirectory gal/ with images in form img_1234.jpg

when I run ikiwiki, I get something completely wrong though:

generated gal/index.html page contains following code repeated for every image:

    <div class="album-viewer">
      <div id="album-img">
        <div class="album-finish">
          <a href="./"><span class="album-arrow">â†‘</span></a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

So no links to any images, etc.

The pages for individual images are generated though, but also not correct. Trails section is perfect, but the main part is wrong:

    <div class="album-prev">
      <a><span class="album-arrow">â†<90></span></a><br />
      <div class="album-thumbnail">
        <span class="selflink">
          <img src="./96x96-img_2913.jpg" width="96" height="72" alt="img 2913" title="img 2913" class="img" /></span>
      </div>
    </div>

This really seems like this should be in the album page and not individul page. It is only thumbnail and not full image. Also the full image is not in the generated html tree at all!

I am using ikiwiki 3.20130518, and got the album sources from the links of [this page](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/contrib/album/) (part manual installation)

Any hint about what do I do wrong?

Thanks Lukas

### bug + patch: not all images shown on album page

Hi smcv, we spoke on irc the other day. Passed `show => "0"` on line 126 in album.pm to remove the limit on the thumbnails shown on the album page. Setting it on the album directive didn't work.

--kjs

> That sounds like a correct solution. I'll fix that in my branch when I work on
> this again. --[[smcv]]

>> Fixed in `album5` branch --s

----

### bug: thumbnailsize doesn't work

As mentioned above by Jaime setting the thumbnailsize doesn't catch either. Or rather if I git push after changing the album directive the generated thumbnails (the image files) are the correct size as set in the directive. The html however uses the default thumbnailsize as hardcoded in album.pm and has broken thumbnails as it links to a file with the default size in the filename.

> [[KathrynAndersen]] fixed this, see below. --[[smcv]]

>> Fixed in `album5` branch --s

Issuing `ikiwiki --rebuild` knocks the system into another gear where the thumbnails show up correctly but this is only due to the html being the same as above (linking to hardcoded thumbnailsize) but the generated thumbnail images are now matching the hardcoded size ignoring the thumbnailsize attribute on the album directive.

For me this behaviour is way beyond my skills to sort out (I'm no coder). The albumplugin ikiwiki combo is very attractive to me and the plugin i soo close to working!

--kjs

### suggested fix for thumbnail size bug

I've tracked down the "always showing the 96x96 thumbnails" bug!

The problem is in the pagetemplate function, which calls "thumbnail" to determine the name of the thumbnail image to use. As you know, the "img" method of generating thumbnails includes the size of the thumbnail as part of its name (to ensure that resizing thumbnails will create a new file of the correct size). The problem is... that in the pagetemplate function, the thumbnailsize is NOT passed in to the call to "thumbnail", so it always returns the default size, 96x96. Hence nothing that anyone can do will change the thumbnails to anything else. Oh, the different-sized thumbnail images ARE created, but they're never linked to.

Here's a context-diff of my fix:

### bug: inability to show more than 10 items

I've found another bug. The album plugin doesn't allow one to have more than 10 items in an album section. This is because it uses "inline" to display album sections, and the default for inline is to show only 10 items. So it only shows 10 items.

What would be good is if the album directive could have a "show" parameter which is passed on to preprocess_inline, so that users could decide how many items to show (including ALL of them, if they give show=0).

### cbaines' commit to change default thumbnail size

Regarding commit `Change the default thumbnail size`: as far as I
understand it, `size => 96x96` is meant to set the image size to
be as large as possible given these constraints: width ≤ 96px,
height ≤ 96px, and the original aspect ratio is preserved. So I
would hope that 96x96 doesn't distort the thumbnails. What distortion
are you seeing, and which versions of Imagemagick and Perlmagick
are you using?

## wishlist + patch: make clicking on the large image go to the next

I've changed the behavior of the "slideshow" to show the next image when clicking the large image as downloading a full resolution image is a rare use case in a gallery of this type imho. The large clicktarget means you are likely to unnecessarily download large files otherwise. I can't quite follow the template, album.pm flow so I can't figure out how to put a "download full resolution" link on the viewer page which would be my next step. To achieve the next link i added ` link => ($nextpage or $album),` around line 454 in `my $img`

## wishlist from kjs

My wishlist for the plugin would include:

[[!template id=gitbranch branch=kjs/album6-imgmeta author="[[Kalle Söderman|kjs]]"]] 

- ~~Reading exif info from the imagefile~~
    - I have now implemented this (in some fashion) and the patch is available in my album6-imgmeta branch. --kjs

- ~~Keeping the full resolution image files out of version control~~ Solved
this by simply creating a underlay for the images. Works out of the box for my
non cgi workflow.
- Being able to create new albums by tag or by manually picking images from other albums. Could be a simple comma separated list of viewer names, or even full urls, in the album directive.
- A counter showing **current image/total number of images in album**. This would mean that you know how many images you have left to click through before you have seen all images in an album. This gives you enought info to decide weather to click through or go back/leave.

## cbaines' CSS changes

Regarding the CSS changes: I'll try to have a look soon, work out
what actually changed (since you re-ordered the CSS, so it isn't
immediately obvious from the diff), and integrate some or all of your
changes. Since Joey shows no signs of wanting to merge it, and "out of tree"
installation is currently a pain, I might split out the CSS changes into a
separate `ikiwiki/album.css` so that the only thing that needs to be merged
into style.css (or into local.css) is an appropriate
`@import` rule.

It shouldn't be necessary to add the album stuff to each individual
theme's style.css unless you actually want an actiontabs album and
a blueview album to be styled differently, because the IkiWiki Makefile
concatenates them: for instance, `/usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/actiontabs/style.css`
is the output of `cat doc/style.css themes/actiontabs/style.css`. So adding it
to `doc/style.css` should be enough? --[[smcv]]

cbaines, would you mind publishing an album with more realistic pixel-sizes
of images using your modified CSS? It's difficult to get an idea of how it
will degrade under conditions like "image size > browser window" with
images as small as the ones you used. You might find
<http://git.pseudorandom.co.uk/smcv/ikiwiki-demos/ikialbum.git>
(`git clone git://git.pseudorandom.co.uk/git/smcv/ikiwiki-demos/ikialbum.git`),
or the same techniques, useful: it contains images with a realistic pixel
count, but very very lossy JPEG compression, to keep the size in bytes low.

It's much, much easier to review changes if you use separate commits for
cosmetic changes like "separate index CSS from viewer CSS" and "more
consistent indentation", and functional changes like turning the prev/next
links from absolutely-positioned to floating. I'd be happy to apply
the cosmetic changes if they were in commits that were literally only
cosmetic changes, with no functional effect.

For the functional bits: I think I'd have used floating boxes instead of the
absolutely-positioned boxes that are currently used if they provided the effect
I wanted. I can't remember exactly why I didn't do that now, but
it might have been because if the browser window shrinks below the image width,
floats have weird behaviour (they push the actual image out of the way), or because
I wanted the entire left/right margin of the image to be clickable to have
a large click-target for scrolling through the album.

If there's something specific that you think is wrong with the CSS in my
branch, could you please explain it, and perhaps we can come up with something
that matches both our requirements?
