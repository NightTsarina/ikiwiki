This plugin enables Markdown processing using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). You can configure it for Pandoc to take over processing of all .mkdn files, or only files with a different extension. Given the features Pandoc has added over the past 6-12 months, this makes for a very powerful combination, e.g. with code block syntax highlighting and lots of options for how to process and display inline TeX.

This is an expanded and updated version of [[Jason Blevin|users/jasonblevins]]'s pandoc plugin. Get it and see further details at <https://github.com/dubiousjim/pandoc-iki>.

Several authors are maintaining a code here: <https://github.com/sciunto-org/ikiwiki-pandoc>. Several enhancements found on github were merged and we keep developing the plugin. PR are welcome. :)
