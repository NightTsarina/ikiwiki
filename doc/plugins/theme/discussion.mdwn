### What license do themes need to have for distribution?

Could someone specify what license the themes need to have to get
distributed in ikiwiki or Debian? The current included theme seem to be
under the GPLv2. Does the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported
License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) also work. This way a
lot of free CSS templates could be included, e. g. from
[freecsstemplates.org](http://www.freecsstemplates.org/). --PaulePanter

### Once one has enabled the 'theme' plugin in the setup file, how does one use themes?

Choose one of the [[themes]] which are bundled with ikiwiki and configure ikiwiki to use it by setting this in your setup file, eg.

    	theme => 'blueview',

### How to enable properly?

So I added "theme" to my config file's "add_plugins" directive, and uncommented the "theme: actiontabs" line.  I then ran "ikwiki --setup wiki.setup" and...  no change on reload.

I'm on Ubuntu 16.04.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
