It would be useful (at least for me) if one could specify
(using a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]]) where the image links to.  For example,
on <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/sidebar/> I'd like to have the
logo link to \[[hurd/logo]] / <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/hurd/logo/>
instead of linking to the PNG image file.  --[[tschwinge]]

It would be handy if the `class` and `id` tags were passed through to the surrounding `table` in the case of `caption` being present.  Would this break anything?  --[[neale]]

[[!template id=gitbranch branch=kjs/img-sharpen author="[[Kalle Söderman|kjs]]"]]

I have created a patch that allows the image to be sharpened when resampled.
There is also an additional option to interlace the image using plane for
progressive display. --[[kjs]]

Is it possible to give an external image URL, must the image be local? One use case would be displaying *badges*, like [[the number of stars|https://img.shields.io/github/stars/joeyh/ikiwiki.svg]] of a [[github project|http://github.com/joeyh/ikiwiki]], but ``\[[!img https://img.shields.io/github/stars/joeyh/ikiwiki.svg]]`` does not work: [[!img https://img.shields.io/github/stars/joeyh/ikiwiki.svg]]. --[[Louis|spalax]]
