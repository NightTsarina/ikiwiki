The theme plugin allows easily applying a theme to your wiki, by
configuring the `theme` setting in the setup file with the name of a theme
to use. The themes you can choose from are all subdirectories, typically
inside `/usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/`. See [[themes]] for an overview
of the themes included in ikiwiki.

You can set the theme via the **theme** option in your config file (after
enabling the plugin). Refresh the wiki after changing it to see the changes.

Hints for theme builders
------------------------

 * Start from an existing [[CSS file|css]], see also the [[css market]] for examples
 * You can override the [[templates]] files by dropping them in a `templates` subdirectory
 * Try to stick with modifying the CSS however, maintaining custom templates is harder
 * If you *do* override a template, note that you will need to rebuild the wiki for it to be applied...
 * ...it may therefore be preferable to load the template directly in your browser to develop it
