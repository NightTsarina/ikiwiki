This plugin allows ikiwiki to push generated pages to another host
by running a command such as `rsync`.

The command to run is specified by setting `rsync_command` in your setup
file. The command will be run in your destdir, so something like this
is a typical command:

	rsync_command => 'rsync -qa --delete . user@host:/path/to/docroot/',

If using rsync over ssh, you will need to enable noninteractive ssh login
to the remote host. It's also a good idea to specify the exact command line
to be permitted in the remote host's `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

A typical ikiwiki configuration when using this plugin is to disable cgi
support, so ikiwiki builds a completely static site that can be served from
the remote host.
