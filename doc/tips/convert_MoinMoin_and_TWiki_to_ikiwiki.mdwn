[[JoshTriplett]] has developed scripts to convert MoinMoin and TWiki wikis
to ikiwikis backed by a git repository, including full history. For
details, see [[his_user_page|JoshTriplett]].

> I have worked on porting this to more recent MoinMoin versions, optimising it and making sure it works reliably even on big wikis with funky things.
> 
>     git clone git://src.anarcat.ath.cx/moin2iki
>
> List of improvements:
>
>* full rewrite of git migration tool to support latest MoinMoin versions (tested with 1.9.x)
>* uses `git fast-import` to improve performance (10 minutes and 200M of ram for a 7 years old 2GB Moinmoin wiki)
>* more reliable as it uses the per-page edit log
>* consistent: multiple runs will generate the same repository
>* re-entrant: can be run multiple times to import new changes
>
> Look at the `moin2git2` script for most of my work, which really consisted on importing the MoinMoin pages into git reliably. Now I am rewriting the MoinMoin parser to generate markdown directly instead of going through HTML, because I want to support translating the macros too.
>
> Big things missing:
>
> * lots of macros are not translated
> * a bunch of markup and exotic uses of parsers will probably fail? 
> * [[todo/internal_definition_list_support/]]
> * [[todo/do_not_make_links_backwards/]]
> * fix up documentation and make sure all the pieces go into place
>
> Comments and feedback always welcome! --[[anarcat]]
