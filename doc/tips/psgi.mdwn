Here's the app.psgi file if you want to run ikiwiki with [PSGI](http://plackperl.org) instead of apache or other web servers:

    use Plack::App::CGIBin;
    use Plack::Builder;
    use Plack::App::File;
    
    builder {
        mount '/ikiwiki.cgi' => Plack::App::CGIBin->new(file => './ikiwiki.cgi')->to_app;
        enable "Plack::Middleware::Static",
            path => sub { s!(^(?:/[^.]*)?/?$)!${1}/index.html! },
                root => '.';
        mount '/' => Plack::App::File->new(root => ".")->to_app;
    };

Put it in your destdir and now your can run `plackup -p <port>`.

Note that you should configure your `url` and `cgiurl` to point to the listening address of plackup.

Also, the app.psgi residing in the destdir means that /app.psgi is accessible from the web server.

Hopefully some day ikiwiki web ui will speak psgi natively.
