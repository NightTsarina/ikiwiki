First, get familiar with [[howto avoid flooding aggregators]].

## Into ikiwiki, from another CMS

7. Copy content into ikiwiki, taking care to:
    7. Match article paths to preserve old permalinks.
    7. Match enclosure paths (or use redirects) to preserve old URLs.
    7. Match titles, post dates, and guids with `\[[!meta]]`.
    7. Match feed paths with permanent redirects from old Atom
       location to `index.atom` (likewise for RSS).
    7. `\[[!inline]]` the articles.
7. Rerun `ikiwiki --setup`.

## Within ikiwiki, from basic to fancy

7. Exclude media files from `\[[!inline]]`.
7. Replace direct `\[[WikiLinks]]` to media files with
   `\[[!meta enclosure="WikiLink/to/media.mp3"]]`.
7. Rerun `ikiwiki --setup`.
