The [ikiwiki-nav](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2968) plugin
for vim eases the editing of IkiWiki wikis, by letting you "follow" the
wikilinks on your file (page), by loading the file associated with a given
wikilink in vim. The plugin takes care of following the ikiwiki linking rules
to figure out which file a wikilink points to 

The plugin also includes commands (and mappings) to make the cursor jump to the
previous/next wikilink in the current file 

##  Jumping to pages 

To open the file associated to a wikilink, place the cursor over its text, and
hit Enter (`<CR>`). This functionality is also available through the
`:IkiJumpToPage` command 

## Moving to next/previous wikilink in current file 

`Ctrl-j` will move the cursor to the next wikilink. `Ctrl-k` will move it to the
previous wikilink. This functionality is also available through the
`:IkiNextWikiLink` command. This command takes one argument, the direction to
move into 

  * `:IkiNextWikiLink 0` will look forward for the wikilink 
  * `:IkiNextWikiLink 1` will look backwards for the wikilink 

## Installation

Copy the `ikiwiki_nav.vim` file to your `.vim/ftplugin` directory.

## Current issues: 

  * The plugin only works for wikilinks contained in a single text line;
    multiline wikilinks are not (yet) seen as such
