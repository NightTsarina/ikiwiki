If you use twitter or identi.ca, here's how to make a box
on the side of your blog that holds your recent status updates
from there, like I have on [my blog](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/)
--[[Joey]] 

* Enable the [[plugins/aggregate]] plugin, and set up a cron
  job for it.
* At the top of your blog's page, add something like the following.
  You'll want to change the urls of course. Be sure to also change
  the inline directive's [[PageSpec]] to link to the location the
  feed is aggregated to, which will be a subpage of the page
  you put this on (blog in this example):

	\[[!template id=note text="""  
	\[[!aggregate expirecount=5 name="dents" url="http://identi.ca/joeyh"  
	feedurl="http://identi.ca/api/statuses/user_timeline/joeyh.atom"]]  
	\[[!inline pages="internal(./blog/dents/*)" template=microblog
	show=5 feeds=no]]
	"""]]

* To filter out `@-replies`, append "and !*@*" to the [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]].
  The same technique can be used for other filtering.

Note: Works best with ikiwiki 3.10 or better.
