# Manual install

These are some notes on installing ikiwiki on Mac OS X Snow Leopard. I have a three year old machine with a lot of stuff on it so it took quite a while, YMMV. 

The best part of installing ikiwiki was learning how to use git. I never used source control before but its pretty slick.


## installing git:

cd /opt/ikiwiki/install

curl http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-(latest version).tar.gz -O

tar xzvf git-(latest version).tar.gz

cd git-(latest version)

./configure --prefix=/usr/local 

make prefix=/usr/local all

sudo make install


git config --global user.name "firstname lastname" 

git config --global user.email "email here"

git config --global color.ui "auto" 


curl http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-manpages-1.7.3.1.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzC /usr/local/share/man/


## installing ikiwiki:
I had terrible trouble installing ikiwiki. It turned out I had accidentally installed Perl through ports. Uninstalling that made everything install nicely.
I got an error on msgfmt. Turns out this is a program in gettext. I installed that and it fixed the error.

cd ..

git clone git://git.ikiwiki.info/

cd git.ikiwiki.info/

perl Makefile.PL  LIB=/Library/Perl/5.10.0

make

sudo make install

when you make ikiwiki it gives you a .git folder with the ikiwiki files. Stay out of this folder. You want to learn how to create a clone and make all your changes in the clone. When you push the changes ikiwiki will update. I moved a file in this folder by accident because I named my working file the same and I couldn't get into the setup page. I had apparently messed up my ikiwiki git repository. I did a pull into my clone, deleted the repository and webserver/ cgi folders and ran a new setup. Then I did a git clone and dragged all my old files into the new clone. Did the git dance and did git push. Then the angels sang.


## using git from inside a git folder:

start with git clone, then learn to do the git dance like this.

git pull

make your changes to your clone

git commit -a -m "message here"

git push


When you can't get into the setup page or you get strange behavior after a setup update the Utilities > Console app is your friend.

## installing gitweb

cd ../git-1.7.3.1/gitweb

make GITWEB_PROJECTROOT="/opt/ikiwiki/" GITWEB_CSS="/gitweb.css" GITWEB_LOGO="/git-logo.png" GITWEB_FAVICON="/git-favicon.png" GITWEB_JS="/gitweb.js"

cp gitweb.cgi /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/

cp /usr/local/share/gitweb/static/git-favicon.png /Library/WebServer/Documents/

cp /usr/local/share/gitweb/static/git-logo.png /Library/WebServer/Documents/

cp /usr/local/share/gitweb/static/gitweb.css /Library/WebServer/Documents/

cp /usr/local/share/gitweb/static/gitweb.js /Library/WebServer/Documents/


sudo chmod 2755 /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/gitweb.cgi

sudo chmod 2755 /Library/WebServer/Documents/git-favicon.png

sudo chmod 2755 /Library/WebServer/Documents/git-logo.png

sudo chmod 2755 /Library/WebServer/Documents/gitweb.css

sudo chmod 2755 /Library/WebServer/Documents/gitweb.js


## installing xapian:

download xapian and omega

I needed pcre: sudo ports install pcre

./configure

make

sudo make install


## installing omega:

I had a build error do to libiconv undefined symbols. sudo port deactivate libiconv took care of it. After install I had trouble with ikiwiki so I did a sudo port install libiconv and ikiwiki came back.

./configure

make

sudo make install


## installing Search::Xapian from CPAN

for some reason this wouldn't install using CPAN console so I went to CPAN online and downloaded the source.

perl Makefile.PL

make

make test

sudo make install

it installed without issue so I'm baffled why it didn't install from command line.

 
 ## setup file
    _!/usr/bin/perl
    _ Ikiwiki setup automator.
    
    _ This setup file causes ikiwiki to create a wiki, check it into revision
    _ control, generate a setup file for the new wiki, and set everything up.
    
    _ Just run: ikiwiki -setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup
    
    _By default, it asks a few questions, and confines itself to the user's home
    _directory. You can edit it to change what it asks questions about, or to
    _modify the values to use site-specific settings.
    require IkiWiki::Setup::Automator;
    
    our $wikiname="your wiki";
    our $wikiname_short="yourwiki";
    our $rcs="git";
    our $admin="your name";
    use Net::Domain q{hostfqdn};
    our $domain="your.domain";                    
    
    IkiWiki::Setup::Automator->import(
    wikiname => $wikiname,
    adminuser => [$admin],
    rcs => $rcs,
    srcdir => "/opt/ikiwiki/$wikiname_short",
    destdir => "/Library/WebServer/Documents/$wikiname_short",
    repository => "/opt/ikiwiki/$wikiname_short.".($rcs eq "monotone" ? "mtn" : $rcs),
    dumpsetup => "/opt/ikiwiki/$wikiname_short.setup",
    url => "http://$domain/$wikiname_short",
    cgiurl => "http://$domain/cgi-bin/$wikiname_short/ikiwiki.cgi",
    cgi_wrapper => "/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/$wikiname_short/ikiwiki.cgi",
    adminemail => "your\@email.com",
    add_plugins => [qw{goodstuff websetup}],
    disable_plugins => [qw{}],
    libdir => "/opt/ikiwiki/.ikiwiki",
    rss => 1,
    atom => 1,
    syslog => 1,
    )
 

## turning on search plugin:

I turned on the plugin from the setup page in ikiwiki but it gave an error when I went to search. Error "Error: /usr/lib/cgi-bin/omega/omega failed: No such file or directory".
I did a  "find / -name "omega" -print" and found the omega program in "/usr/local/lib/xapian-omega/bin/omega".

Then I went into the 2wiki.setup file and replaced the bad path, updated and badda-boom badda-bing.
