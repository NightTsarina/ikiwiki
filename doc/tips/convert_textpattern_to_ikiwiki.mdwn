[[Amitai Schleier|schmonz]] wrote an `ikiwiki-import` program that
currently can only [import from
Textpattern](https://github.com/schmonz/txp2ikiwiki), and then only
if configured exactly like the site he imported. But `ikiwiki-import`
is designed to be extensible, and maybe after a little extending
it'll be suitable for inclusion in ikiwiki.
