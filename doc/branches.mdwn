In order to refer to a branch in one of the [[git]] repositories, for
example when submitting a [[patch]], you can use the
[[templates/gitbranch]] template. For example:

	\[[!template id=gitbranch branch=yourrepo/amazingbranch author="\[[yourname]]"]]

Branches referred to in open [[bugs]] and [[todo]]:

[[!inline pages="(todo/* or bugs/*) and link(/branches) and !link(bugs/done)
and !link(todo/done) and !*/*/*" show=0 archive=yes]]

Long-lived branches in the main git repository:

* `debian-stable` is used for updates to the old version included in
  Debian's stable release, and `debian-testing` is used for updates to
  Debian's testing release. (These and similar branches will be rebased.)
* `ignore` gets various branches merged to it that [[Joey]] wishes to ignore
  when looking at everyone's unmerged changes.
* `pristine-tar` contains deltas that
  [pristine-tar](http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/pristine-tar)
  can use to recreate released tarballs of ikiwiki
