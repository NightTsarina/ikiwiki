Here's how to get ikiwiki in source or prepackaged form. See [[setup]] for
how to use it, and be sure to add your wiki to [[IkiwikiUsers]] if you use
ikiwiki.

## source

Ikiwiki is developed in a [[git_repository|git]].

The best place to download a tarball of the latest release is from 
<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki>.

Manual installation steps and requirements are listed on the [[install]] page.

## Debian / Ubuntu packages

To install with [apt](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html#_basic_package_management_operations), if using Debian or Ubuntu:

        apt-get install ikiwiki

Or download the deb from <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/ikiwiki>.

There is a backport of a recent version of ikiwiki for Debian 5.0 at
<http://packages.debian.org/lenny-backports/ikiwiki>.

There is also an unofficial backport of ikiwiki for Ubuntu Jaunty, provided by
[[Paweł_Tęcza|users/ptecza]],
at [http://gpa.net.icm.edu.pl/ubuntu/](http://gpa.net.icm.edu.pl/ubuntu/index-en.html).

## RPM packages

Fedora versions 8 and newer have RPMs of ikiwiki available.

Ikiwiki's source includes a RPM spec file, which you can use to build your
own RPM.

## BSD ports

NetBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, and many other platforms: [pkgsrc](http://www.pkgsrc.org/) has an [ikiwiki package](http://pkgsrc.se/www/ikiwiki).

FreeBSD has ikiwiki in its
[ports collection](http://www.freshports.org/www/ikiwiki/).

## Other packages

The [openSUSE Build Service](http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=ALL&p=1&q=ikiwiki) has packages for openSUSE
