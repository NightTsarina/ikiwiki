# NAME

ikiwiki-makerepo - check an ikiwiki srcdir into revision control

# SYNOPSIS

ikiwiki-makerepo git|svn|monotone|darcs|cvs srcdir repo

ikiwiki-makerepo bzr|mercurial srcdir

# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki-makerepo` injects an existing `srcdir` directory, containing
sources for an ikiwiki wiki, into revision control. It is rarely
run directly; consider using `ikiwiki -setup /etc/ikiwiki/wiki.setup` instead
to set up a wiki.

For git, the `repo` is created as a bare git repository, and the srcdir is
made into a clone of it. (monotone and darcs are similar.)

For svn and cvs, the `repo` is the centralized repository, and the `srcdir`
is a checkout of it.

For for mercurial and bzr, the srcdir is the only repository set up.

For darcs, the master repo's apply hook will be preconfigured to call a
ikiwiki wrapper.

Note that for monotone, you are assumed to already have run "mtn genkey"
to generate a key.

# EXAMPLE 

`ikiwiki-makerepo git /srv/web/wiki /srv/git/wiki.git/`

This creates a bare repository `/srv/git/wiki.git/`,
and sets up `/srv/web/wiki` to be a clone of it, committing
any files that already exist in that directory.
