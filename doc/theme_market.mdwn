[[!meta title="Theme Market" description="user-contributed themes for ikiwiki"]]

This is a directory of user-contributed ikiwiki themes. For more information about themes, see the [[plugins/theme]] page.

It is usually preferable (and more maintainable) to create a [[css]] file instead of a full theme, but sometimes the HTML produced by ikiwiki just isn't compatible with your template, so you need to modify the templates provided. This is when you need to make your own theme.

Feel free to add your own [[theme|themes]] here, but first consider writing a simpler [[css]] file and adding it to the [[css market]] instead, or look at the [[themes]] shipped with ikiwiki.
