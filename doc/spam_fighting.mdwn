ikiwiki.info is occasionally attacked by persistent spammers who keep
making changes. Anyone can revert spam changes, and several people do.

If you find a spammer, and revert their spam, please post a link to the
spam commit here. After review, these can be used to ban spammers by login,
or for the really persistent ones, by IP (or even IP range).

If you're a trusted member of the ikiwiki community and would like access
to the setup branch in git to be able to update the ban list, get in touch
with joey with a ssh public key. Once your key is added, you will be able
to edit the ikiwiki.setup file on the setup branch, and push changes.
You will also be able to access the recent web server logs to find IP
addresses, by running: `ssh b-ikiwiki@ikiwiki.info logdump > access.log`
