[[!template id=gitbranch branch=kjs/master author="[[Kalle Söderman|kjs]]"]]

Mostly using ikiwiki with the [[/plugins/contrib/album/]] and [[plugins/osm]]
plugins. My git repo with tweaks including the simplebw theme and various
changes to the [[plugins/contrib/album]] plugin and templates can be found in
my master branch

Note that the master brach is all my changes piled into one branch. **I can't
code (clone my repo above if you don't believe me!) so noone should run my
code without checking it first.** I can't stress this enough.

The main changes I've done are the following

* How you browse through the images. The interface i simplified and you click
the image to view the next rather than download it.
* Added separate download link for full resolution image unless size is set to
full in the album directive.
* Extract metadata from exif/xmp data in the image according to preexisting
pattern in the album plugin. This was done using
[Image::ExifTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ExifTool.html)
* Autogenerate [[ikiwiki/directive/tag/]]s from exif:Subject if possible.
* Use the albumitem template to create tag pages with thumbnails.
* Additional albumpreview template which allows you to define a thumbnail that
link to the album. Useful for visual index of albums.
* Extract GPS data and populate a [[plugins/osm]] waypoint if available.
* Add span around osm icon to allow for styling.

For my public websites above the image metadata is "manually" ie shell script
populated but I'll eventually start using automatic metadata for new images.
