# Plugins

I wrote and maintain a few plugins, which are available here: [[https://atelier.gresille.org/projects/gresille-ikiwiki]].

[[!map pages="plugins/contrib/* and ! plugins/contrib/*/* and link(.)"]]

# Wishlist

I have a few things in mind. Their status is something between *I will implement it someday* to *maybe someone could need this* or *I will need it if I implement this killer website I have in mind*.

* [[plugins/contrib/addtag]]: Add the necessary javascript in the edit page to enable adding tags to the page by simply clicking one some link. Second step: looks inside page content for tags as user is typing, and allow user to remove them by clicking somewhere.
* [[plugins/contrib/jssearchtag]]: Create a page where user can tick or untick any combination of tag (s)he want, and dynamically sees an inline of the matching pages. I have to see to what extent the [[plugins/contrib/jssearchfield|jssearchfield]] plugin already does the same thing (not tested yet).
* [[plugins/contrib/htaccessmanager]]: Create a cgi page to manage a htaccess file.
* Automatically add calendar pages (see the [[ikiwiki-calendar discussion|ikiwiki-calendar/discussion]]).
