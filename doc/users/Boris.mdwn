[[!meta title="Boris Vogeler"]]

Boris uses ikiwiki for several years now as both a wiki engine and, quite successfully, as static site generator, one example would be [[nb-instrument.com|http://nb-instrument.com]].   

So while apparently coming from the frontend, he never wanted to really learn any of the messy stuff that lingers around in this realm besides HTML and CSS.   

He is well aware of the web being an amateurish, crappy place, while he thinks that the internet as such, still can be thought of as "a natural resource" like Alan Kay pointed out.     

To learn to write things from scratch he's currently looking at Yesod and alternative frameworks in Haskell and in Rust, learning Haskell (since it's beautiful) and later on Rust (since it wants to be wise) to dig deep into functional languages for building future proof applications. Working as a sound engineer, musician and producer, running a small studio in an artists run space, he actually is doing this to be able to show to his small kids how importand the understanding of fundamentals is.
