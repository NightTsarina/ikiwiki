## Using CSS with ikiwiki

Ikiwiki comes with two CSS stylesheets: [[style.css]] and [[local.css]].
The idea is to customize the second one, overriding the first one and
defining brand new rendering rules.

While ikiwiki's default use of stylesheets is intentionally quite plain and
minimalistic, CSS allows creating any kind of look you can dream up.

The [[theme_plugin|plugins/theme]] provides some prepackaged [[themes]] in an
easy to use way.

The [[css_market]] page is an attempt to collect user contributed local.css
files.

## Per-page CSS

The [[plugins/meta]] plugin can be used to add additional style sheets to a
page.

The [[plugins/localstyle]] plugin can be used to override the toplevel
[[local.css]] for a whole section of the wiki.
