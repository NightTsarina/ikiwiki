A theme provides a style.css file, and any associated images to give
ikiwiki a nice look and feel. The local.css [[CSS]] file is left
free for you to further customize.

Ikiwiki now comes with several themes contributed by users.
You can enable the [[theme_plugin|plugins/theme]] to use any of
these, but you can also deploy custom themes maintained by the
community from the [[theme market]].

[[!img actiontabs_small.png align=left]] The **actiontabs** theme, contributed by
[[svend]]. This style sheet displays the action list
(Edit, RecentChanges, etc.) as tabs.
