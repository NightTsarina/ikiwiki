Question: Is there a way to generate a listing that shows *both* title and description meta information? Currently, a \[\[!map ...]] shows only one of the two, but I'd like to generate a navigation that looks like a description list. For example:

 * This is the title meta information.

   This is the description meta information

 * This is another title.  

   And so on ...

Is that possible?

The site I'm trying to set up right now (not really a wiki - no public editing) is divided into topics.  Topics are pages that have `\[[!meta link="/topic"]]`.  Topic pages contain an index of their subpages (done with `\[[!inline]]`); the subpages are the real content.  I want a map in the sidebar that lists:

 * all of the topics;
 * all of the first-level subpages of the *current topic only*.

That is, if the current page is "Topic A" or "Topic A/Page 1", then the map should look like

    Topic A
        Page 1
        Page 2
        Page 3
    Topic B
    Topic C

but if the current page is "Topic B" or one of its subpages, then the map should look like

    Topic A
    Topic B
        Page 1
        Page 2
        Page 3
    Topic C

On the top-level index page, or on any other page that is neither a topic nor a subpage of a topic, the map should list only the topics.

Is there any way to do that?  I don't mind mucking around with `\[[!meta]]` on every page if that's what it takes.
