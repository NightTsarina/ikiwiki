Things can get messy if you have enabled the global sidebar setting and you browse the `ikiwiki/directive/*` pages. You will get the content of `ikiwiki/directive/sidebar` as a sidebar to all the directives page... I have emptied the sidebar.mdwn page on our wiki to work around that, but isn't this a bug? --[[anarcat]]
