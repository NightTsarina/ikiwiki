The `edittemplate` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/edittemplate desc=edittemplate]] plugin.

This directive allows registering template pages, that provide default
content for new pages created using the web frontend. To register a
template, insert an [[ikiwiki/directive/edittemplate]] directive on some other
page.

	\[[!edittemplate template="bugtemplate" match="bugs/*"]]
 
A recommended place to put the directive is on the parent page
of the pages that will be created using the template. So the above
example would be put on the bugs page. (Do not put the directive on the
template page itself.)

In the above example, the page named "bugtemplate" is registered as a
template to be used when any page named "bugs/*" is created. To avoid
the directive displaying a note about the template being registered, add
"silent=yes".

Often the template page contains a simple skeleton for a particular type of
page. For the bug report pages in the above example, it might look
something like:

	Package: 
	Version: 
	Reproducible: y/n
	Details:

The template page can also contain [[!cpan HTML::Template]] directives,
like other ikiwiki [[templates]].

Two variables might be set:

* `<TMPL_VAR name>` is replaced with the name of the page being
  created.
  
* `<TMPL_VAR uuid>` is replaced with a version 4 (random) UUID.
