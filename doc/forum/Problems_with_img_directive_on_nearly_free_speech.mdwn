Hey everyone, I have a problem with the img plugin/directive. I get an error stating "[[!img Error: Image::Magick is not installed]]". So the directive "tag" thingie is shown with an error where I had written the path to the image in the markdown file (of this blog post, in that case…). Any ideas why this might happen? Maybe a problem with my hoster, which is nearlyfreespeech (I couldn't install ```Image::Magick``` with either ```PERL5LIB=`pwd`/ikiwiki:`pwd`/ikiwiki/cpan:`pwd`/lib/perl5 PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("Image::Magick")'``` nor with ```PERL5LIB=`pwd`/ikiwiki:`pwd`/ikiwiki/cpan:`pwd`/lib/perl5 PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->force(install => "Image::Magick")'``` which I both adapted from [this tip](https://ikiwiki.info/tips/nearlyfreespeech/). But in two admittedly very old (members only) forum posts (from 2003 and 2004, respectively) they said, they do indeed have support for PerlMagick.)?

Thanks in advance as allways for any help you can offer!
