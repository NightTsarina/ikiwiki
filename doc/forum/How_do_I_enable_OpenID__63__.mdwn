I'm trying to set up a new ikiwiki based blog and I want commentors to be able to log in with OpenID.  To enable OpenID I installed Net::OpenID::Consumer, and enabled the openid plugin in my blog.setup file.  Despite doing that I still only see the username and password in the login screen.  What am I missing?
