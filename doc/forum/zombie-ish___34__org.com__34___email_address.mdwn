I have a bogus admin email address infesting a new wiki. 

The actual address -- as is on clear display in the wiki's setup file -- is of the form "bob@bobsdomain.org". The infestation, which I cannot kill, or so it seems, is of the form "bob@bobsdomain.org.com".

I have done 'ikiwiki --rebuild --setup mywikis.setup' to no avail. I have grepped everywhere I can think of looking for "org.com." Also no joy.
