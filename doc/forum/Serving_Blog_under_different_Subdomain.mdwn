I'm working on consolidating my blog and wiki with ikiwiki. I have the following question: Is it possible to serve a blog under a different subdomain? For example: URL of the wiki: ```wiki.example.com``` and I would like to be able to reach the blog under the URL ```blog.example.com```. The permalink structure right now looks like this: ```wiki.example.com/blog/post/``` is it possible to rewrite is so it is served as ```blog.example.com/post/```. I don't even know if this is a question for the ikiwiki forum, but I need to start somewhere.

Thanks in advance for any ideas on how to accomplish that!
