I've modified the plugin adding the possibility of indexing attachments. Only
PDF attachments for now, but support for other filetypes should be real easy to add.

The changes to `IkiWiki/Plugin/search.pm` are available at
<http://git.devnull.li/ikiwiki.git>, in the `srchatt` branch.

I have a small question about filenames and security: I'm using `qx` to execute
the program that extracts the text from the PDF files, but `qx` executes a
whole string, and passes it not to the program I want to run, but to a shell,
so it is possible (I think) to craft a filename that, in a shell, expands to
something nasty.

How do the Perl/IkiWiki experts suggest to handle these potentially unsafe
filenames? I've thought of the following options:

  * Running the text extractor program using `Proc::Safe`. I could not find a
    Debian package for it, and I'd rather avoid adding another dependency to
    IkiWiki.
  * Running the text extractor program as suggested in the `perlipc` document,
    using `fork` + `exec`.

I haven't done any of those because I'd like to check if there are any helpers
in IkiWiki to do this. Perhaps the `IkiWiki::possibly_foolish_untaint` function
does it? (I didn't really understand what it does...)
