I'd like to use the cutpaste plugin, but not only on a file-local basis: fileA
has \[[!cut id=foo text="foo"]], and fileB does \[[!absorb pagenames=fileA]],
and can then use \[[!paste id=foo]].

Therefore, I've written an [*absorb* directive /
plugin](http://schwinge.homeip.net/~thomas/tmp/absorb.pm), which is meant to
absorb pages in order to get hold of their *cut* and *copy* directives'
contents.  This does work as expected.  But it also absorbs page fileA's *meta*
values, like a *meta title*, etc.  How to avoid / solve this?

Alternatively, do you have a better suggestion about how to achieve what I
described in the first paragraph?
