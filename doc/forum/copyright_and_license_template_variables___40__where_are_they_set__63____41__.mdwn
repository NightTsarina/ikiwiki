The default template includes TMPL_IF LICENSE and TMPL_IF COPYRIGHT, but I can't figure out where these are set.

This page seems to indicate they are created by the [[plugins/meta]] plugin:

[[Default Content for Copyright and License|plugins/contrib/default_content_for___42__copyright__42___and___42__license__42__/]]

Is this true? It just seems a little odd that the default template contains variables that are set by a non-default plugin, so I just wanted to confirm that.

Thanks!
