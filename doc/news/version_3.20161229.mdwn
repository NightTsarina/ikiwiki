   * Security: force CGI::FormBuilder-&gt;field to scalar context where
     necessary, avoiding unintended function argument injection
     analogous to [[!debcve CVE-2014-1572]]. In ikiwiki this could be used to
     forge commit metadata, but thankfully nothing more serious.
     ([[!debcve CVE-2016-9646]])
   * Security: try revert operations in a temporary working tree before
     approving them. Previously, automatic rename detection could result in
     a revert writing outside the wiki srcdir or altering a file that the
     reverting user should not be able to alter, an authorization bypass.
     ([[!debcve CVE-2016-10026]] represents the original vulnerability.)
     The incomplete fix released in 3.20161219 was not effective for git
     versions prior to 2.8.0rc0.
     ([[!debcve CVE-2016-9645]] represents that incomplete solution.)
   * Add CVE references for CVE-2016-10026
   * Add automated test for using the CGI with git, including
     CVE-2016-10026
     - Build-depend on libipc-run-perl for better build-time test coverage
   * Add missing ikiwiki.setup for the manual test for CVE-2016-10026
   * git: don't issue a warning if the rcsinfo CGI parameter is undefined
   * git: do not fail to commit changes with a recent git version
     and an anonymous committer"""]]
