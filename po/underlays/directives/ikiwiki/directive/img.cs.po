"This is an image handling directive.  While ikiwiki supports inlining "
"full-size images by making a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]] that points to the image, "
"using this directive you can easily scale down an image for inclusion onto a "
"page, providing a link to a full-size version."

"The `size` parameter is optional, defaulting to full size. Note that the "
"original image's aspect ratio is always preserved, even if this means making "
"the image smaller than the specified size. You can also specify only the "
"width or the height, and the other value will be calculated based on it: "
"\"200x\", \"x200\""

"You can also pass `alt`, `title`, `class`, `align`, `id`, `hspace`, and "
"`vspace` parameters.  These are passed through unchanged to the html img "
"tag. If you include a `caption` parameter, the caption will be displayed "
"centered beneath the image."

"The `link` parameter is used to control whether the scaled image links to "
"the full size version. By default it does; set \"link=somepage\" to link to "
"another page instead, or \"link=no\" to disable the link, or "
"\"link=http://url\" to link to a given url."
