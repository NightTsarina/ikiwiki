"This is a directive that allows including one wiki page inside another.  The "
"most common use of inlining is generating blogs and RSS or Atom feeds."

"Any pages that match the specified [[PageSpec]] (in the example, any "
"[[SubPage]] of \"blog\") will be part of the blog, and the newest 10 of them "
"will appear in the page. Note that if files that are not pages match the "
"[[PageSpec]], they will be included in the feed using RSS enclosures, which "
"is useful for podcasting."

"The optional `rootpage` parameter tells the wiki that new posts to this blog "
"should default to being [[SubPages|SubPage]] of \"blog\", and enables a form "

msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid "`pages` - A [[PageSpec]] of the pages to inline."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`show` - Specify the maximum number of matching pages to inline.  Default is "
"10, unless archiving, when the default is to show all.  Set to 0 to show all "
"matching pages."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`archive` - If set to \"yes\", only list page titles and some metadata, not "
"full contents."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`description` - Sets the description of the rss feed if one is generated.  "
"Defaults to the name of the wiki."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`skip` - Specify a number of pages to skip displaying. Can be useful to "
"produce a feed that only shows archived pages."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`postform` - Set to \"yes\" to enable a form to post new pages to a blog."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid "`postformtext` - Set to specify text that is displayed in a postform."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`rootpage` - Enables the postform, and allows controling where newly posted "
"pages should go, by specifiying the page that they should be a [[SubPage]] "
"of."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Here are some less often needed parameters:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`actions` - If set to \"yes\" add links to the bottom of the inlined pages "
"for editing and discussion (if they would be shown at the top of the page "
"itself)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`rss` - controls generation of an rss feed. If the wiki is configured to "
"generate rss feeds by default, set to \"no\" to disable. If the wiki is "
"configured to `allowrss`, set to \"yes\" to enable."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"`atom` - controls generation of an atom feed. If the wiki is configured to "
"generate atom feeds by default, set to \"no\" to disable. If the wiki is "
"configured to `allowatom`, set to \"yes\" to enable."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '

"`feeds` - controls generation of all types of feeds. Set to \"no\" to "
"disable generating any feeds."

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"* `id` - Set to specify the value of the HTML `id` attribute for the\n"
" feed links or the post form. Useful if you have multiple forms in the\n"
" same page.\n"
"* `template` - Specifies the template to fill out to display each inlined\n"
"  page. By default the `inlinepage` template is used, while\n"
"  the `archivepage` template is used for archives. Set this parameter to\n"
"  use some other, custom template, such as the `titlepage` template that\n"
"  only shows post titles or the `microblog` template, optimised for\n"
"  microblogging. Note that you should still set `archive=yes` if\n"
"  your custom template does not include the page content.\n"
"* `raw` - Rather than the default behavior of creating a blog,\n"
"  if raw is set to \"yes\", the page will be included raw, without additional\n"
"  markup around it, as if it were a literal part of the source of the \n"
"  inlining page.\n"
"* `sort` - Controls how inlined pages are [[sorted|pagespec/sorting]].\n"
"  The default is to sort the newest created pages first.\n"
"* `reverse` - If set to \"yes\", causes the sort order to be reversed.\n"
"* `feedshow` - Specify the maximum number of matching pages to include in\n"
"  the rss/atom feeds. The default is the same as the `show` value above.\n"
"* `feedonly` - Only generate the feed, do not display the pages inline on\n"
"  the page.\n"
"* `quick` - Build archives in quick mode, without reading page contents for\n"
"  metadata. This also turns off generation of any feeds.\n"
"* `timeformat` - Use this to specify how to display the time or date for pages\n"
"  in the blog. The format string is passed to the strftime(3) function.\n"
"* `feedpages` - A [[PageSpec]] of inlined pages to include in the rss/atom\n"
"  feeds. The default is the same as the `pages` value above, and only pages\n"
"  matched by that value are included, but some of those can be excluded by\n"
"  specifying a tighter [[PageSpec]] here.\n"
"* `guid` - If a URI is given here (perhaps a UUID prefixed with `urn:uuid:`),\n"
"  the Atom feed will have this as its `<id>`. The default is to use the URL\n"
"  of the page containing the `inline` directive.\n"
"* `feedfile` - Can be used to change the name of the file generated for the\n"
"  feed. This is particularly useful if a page contains multiple feeds.\n"
"  For example, set \"feedfile=feed\" to cause it to generate `page/feed.atom`\n"
"  and/or `page/feed.rss`. This option is not supported if the wiki is\n"
"  configured not to use `usedirs`.\n"
"* `pagenames` - If given instead of `pages`, this is interpreted as a\n"
"  space-separated list of links to pages (with the same\n"
"  [[SubPage/LinkingRules]] as in a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]]), and they are inlined\n"
"  in exactly the order given: the `sort` and `pages` parameters cannot be used\n"
"  in conjunction with this one.\n"
