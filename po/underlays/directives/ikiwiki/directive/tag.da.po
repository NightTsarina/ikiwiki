"The tags work the same as if you had put a (hidden) [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]] on "
"the page for each tag, so you can use a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] match all pages "

"Note that if the wiki is configured to use a tagbase, then the tags will be "
"located under a base directory, such as \"tags/\". This is a useful way to "
"avoid having to write the full path to tags, if you want to keep them "
"grouped together out of the way. Also, since ikiwiki then knows where to put "
"tags, it will automatically create tag pages when new tags are used."

"Bear in mind that specifying a tagbase means you will need to incorporate it "

"`tag`, you would match pages tagged \"foo\" with `link(tag/foo)`."
