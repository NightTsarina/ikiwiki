"This directive allows ikiwiki to be configured to hit a URL each time it "
"updates the wiki. One way to use this is in conjunction with the [[!iki "
"plugins/pingee desc=pingee]] plugin to set up a loosely coupled mirror "
"network, or a branched version of a wiki. By pinging the mirror or branch "
"each time the main wiki changes, it can be kept up-to-date."
